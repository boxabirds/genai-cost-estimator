	P R O C E E D I N G S  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Good morning everyone.  We'll get started a moment or two early here.  Can people hear me in the other room?  Great.   
This is the first meeting of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture or AC21.  The Secretary of Agriculture has brought back the AC21 after a hiatus of about two and a half years.    
I hope that everyone's travels here weren't complicated too much by the storm.  We've had more than the usual excitement around D.C. over the last week or so.  			Before I forget, let me ask everyone to please shut off your phones and blackberries.  They interfere with the transcript which we're preparing for this meeting.  It creates a hum in it.  So please shut off your devices.   
My name is Michael Schechtman, and I am the executive secretary and designated federal official for the  
AC21.  I've been working on ag biotech science and policy here at USDA for over two decades.  I'd like to welcome you all to Washington, and to this meeting.    
I'd like to specifically welcome our committee members, I believe all 23 of whom are here today; and our ex officio members, at least one of whom is here now, and several more who will probably join us from other federal departments and agencies.    
And also I'd like to welcome the members of the public who have come here today and are listening to our proceedings from the room next door and perhaps some of whom will be providing statements to the committee later this afternoon.  Members of the AC21 and our ex officio members will all introduce themselves in a little while.    
As you learned late yesterday, we have rearranged the agenda at the last minute to accommodate the scheduling demands of USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack.  I will have more to say about how the meeting is going to run in a few minutes, and about the committee itself.  But first, let me introduce to you our chairman, Mr. Russell Redding, who is the Dean of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences at Delaware Valley College, and former Pennsylvania Secretary of Agriculture.  Russell.   
MR. REDDING:  Michael, thank you, and let me add a welcome as well.  I really appreciate each of you agreeing to serve, number one, giving us the benefit of your good thinking and life experiences.  Some of you have been at this table before on this topic and certainly appreciate that historical perspective as we go into this conversation.   
As Michael mentioned, there will be additional time for introductory comments and to include the committee.  And I will have some other comments as well.  But we are very fortunate this morning to have Secretary Vilsack be here just to kick this off.    
And I think that was, for whatever those changes were, I think it speaks to, you know, the importance that he has placed on the committee, the committee's work, and from the chairman's perspective.  And I'm sure from the committee's perspective, just having the benefit of the Secretary who has appointed you give the insight, the boundaries, is important.  
This is a big topic.  It's a complex topic.  And having some time to really hear from the Secretary in terms of his expectations, I think, will be to our benefit as a committee, and certainly help us focus here in the next couple of days on our work; but also, you know, longer term, what we see as the need.  So I look forward to the conversation that we'll have about biotechnology.   
I've tried to, you know, review the previous work of the committee.  And a lot of really good work done, by the way.  I mean, for those that have been on that committee, an exceptional job.  This is not a topic that lends itself to simplicity.  It just isn't.  And that is in part why there is an advisory committee.    
But it is so important to the future of agriculture that we have to have that conversation.  And we need to do it here as professionals.  We need to do it with our own perspectives around, both around the country and around the organizations that we represent, and around the different states, and with all of the complexities of that topic.  But we need to have the conversation.    
And I really appreciate the Secretary re-initiating this advisory committee.  It speaks, one, to the importance, but also the recurrence of this theme in most everything we do, right, from the environment to the food production, to food security, to trade and on and on.  It is just a recurring theme and really requires the best thinking that we can provide to the Secretary and to the USDA.    
So I look forward to the conversation.  And I say conversation versus debate, you know.  There will be those awkward moments, for sure, but that is what the topic is about.  And anytime you have a topic that is this central to everybody's life, in one form or another, you can expect to have the type of sensitivities and debates and spirited comments, a lot of passion around it.  But that is the conversation we need to have.  And I look forward to that.  
As your chairman I will try to, you know, work our way through these conversations.  I will tell you that there will be things that will arise that will simply have to be put on the “to be resolved” list.  We're not going to have time to get to all of them.    
Certainly, we'll take our lead from the Secretary in terms of his priorities and where he needs the most immediate attention.  And there will be some other things, that are all good topics, but they are going to have to wait in terms of how we address them and approach them.    
So I don't want that to limit the debate, but just know at the outset that we're not going to be able to tackle all of what everybody expects us to do as a committee.  We simply don't have that kind of time.  We certainly have the talent, but we don't have the time.  And we're going to have to then come back to those points a bit later.  Do you want to continue with \--   
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. REDDING:  We were just commenting about the appropriate break here for the Secretary to step in.  And he will be on a fairly tight time line, but I look forward to his comments.   
And I understand that there will be some opportunity for the committee to exchange some Q and A with the Secretary, as well, before he needs to depart.  So that will be good for the committee versus the public comment.   Of course we'll get to that later this afternoon, but we want to make sure while we have him and his time here,	that we have a chance for the committee to ask any questions from his comments.  So I look forward to that as well.  
Part of the appeal, quite frankly, for me as I looked at this advisory committee, and being part of the work, is the presumption that all sectors of agriculture need to thrive.  And I know that the Secretary believes the same way.  This whole coexistence discussion, it's   
coexistence for all of the different aspects of production agriculture.    
We know that agriculture is a complex industry, and certainly this issue, biotechnology, is part of that conversation.  But having served as a Secretary of Agriculture in Pennsylvania, you know, the debates that we've had around biotechnology are the same as are playing out in other regions and other states around the country.  And they are, and they are challenging.  No doubt about it.   
We come away from some of those debates, and you understand just how important agriculture is, but also how the industry is viewed by many people.  And I think that's an important point, is that at the end of the day we're in the food business.  Right.  
So what people do who are expecting, were expecting to buy that food and to consume that food have a lot of say about what that looks like.  And again, not an easy thing to do because we also know that, you know, we have a lot of folks who are fortunate to be well fed in this country.  We also understand that there are a lot of folks who are not as fortunate as we are.  And you cannot have a charitable food system without a food system that's charitable.   
As the Secretary, I was always sort of humbled by the number of folks who were in the position that are consumers, but they are consumers who aren't in the position to go to the store and pull off the shelf what they like.  Right?   
And in Pennsylvania, we had 1.3 million people who were in that predicament.  Nationally, of course, it's much bigger, but in the neighborhood of 10 percent of our population; so 30-40 million people.  All of those are folks who have got to be concerned about \-- and that's just the U.S.    
I mean, you start reaching out, we've looked around the country and around the world, and you realize how fortunate we are to have the agricultural production systems we have, and the delivery systems.  But we also know we've got a responsibility for those folks who are consumers of every type.  So that's an important, important part of the conversation.  
But agriculture is at the intersection of so many of the larger societal issues.  And that puts us in the center of this debate and this discussion about the future of agriculture here in America.  And that's at both the food production side and technology, the environment, and so forth.  So that's all interwoven in this conversation about the biotechnology.  
We expect, you know, a pretty cooperative environment.  I mean, I would hope that we can certainly exhibit our views, strong views on the topic.  Each of you carry that expertise to the table.  And I think that's	the beauty of this committee, both in terms of a general Charter, but also in terms of its makeup here.    
I had a chance to look, to review briefly the biographical sketches.  And I'm impressed that we can assemble a group this diverse on the same day to tackle this topic.  But it really is humbling when I look at the life experiences that each of you carry to the table, the scope and scale of the geographic diversity, professional diversity, and those that make decisions about investments in biotechnology all the way through the food chain to the consumer, that we're all here at the table.   
And I think that lends itself to a much better product at the end of the day.  Because at the end of the day I think the Secretary is going to want us to deliver some reasoned recommendations around biotechnology.  But they've got to be defensible recommendations.   
And when I looked at the work of the previous advisory committees, that's what I took away.  I mean, they are defensible.  That doesn't mean you had consensus on those points.  And you certainly noted the differences.  And I think the Secretary will again expect us to do the same thing, where we have support, let's note that; where we have diverging opinions on a topic, let's note that as well, because I think that's part of informing this debate both for the Secretary and the USDA as well.   
So welcome, Mr. Secretary.  
MR. VILSACK:  Good morning.  
MR. REDDING:  Great to see you.  
MR. VILSACK:  Nice to see you.  Good morning.  
MR. REDDING:  Mr. Secretary, we have a chance just to do a few introductory comments, but I know you are on a tight time line today \--   
MR. VILSACK:  Yes.   
MR. REDDING:  \-- as usual.  But we want to take a moment here and just say how honored we are that you are with us, that you have reinitiated this advisory committee.  I think it speaks to certainly the issues that you've been confronted with around the country and around the world, but also to your belief that there are answers in getting the right people together to really tackle some of these issues.  		So I want to say thank you for the time today.   We have a great committee here, and I appreciate the work that's been done to select the right group of folks.  Many of you know the Secretary is a former governor of Iowa, two terms as a State Senator, as a mayor.  He was a Democratic nominee for president in 2008, a lifetime in public service, so spending a lot of time working through these thorny public issues at many different levels.  And he has continued that leadership here at the USDA.    
So we are very fortunate to have you in the leadership post that you are in.  We appreciate your public service, and the good work that's being done by the USDA in so many different fronts, from conservation to food programs, can certainly will add to that list the work in biotechnology.  So with that, Mr. Secretary, welcome.   
MR. VILSACK:  Thank you.  Russell, thank you very much.  And first of all, I want to express my appreciation to you for your willingness to chair this important discussion and conversation you are about to enter in on.   
Russell is from my home state of Pennsylvania, and served in a variety of capacities, including as the Commissioner and Secretary of Agriculture in Pennsylvania.  We had an opportunity to work with each other during the course of tough 2009 situation with the dairy industry, and I know him to be someone who is dedicated very much to making sure that folks get along in the countryside.    
And that's why I've asked him to serve in what I think is one of the most important discussions and positions that I've had the opportunity to create in the time that I've been Secretary.  So I want to thank you very much for your willingness to take this on.    
And while I'm extending thank you's, I want to thank each and every one of you for your willingness to be here today.  Many of you have traveled significant distances, taken time from important work that you do, and from your family and friends to be engaged in this conversation.  And it's an important and significant conversation.  And I appreciate the sacrifice that you are making to be part of this, and I want you to know that we at USDA appreciate your willingness to be part of this.  
This is a department that really requires significant input from people who are in the field.  And we have a number of advisory committees and activities at USDA all of which really do benefit from input from those who understand the details and the consequences and the significance and the complexities of issues that we talk about in this building.   
Those issues are often not fully appreciated by folks outside of agriculture, outside of rural America, outside of the issues that we deal with.  And I think sometimes people look at issues involving agriculture and food as somewhat simplistic.  And everyone around this table understands and appreciates it is far from that.  It is very, very complex.   
I have often said that the business of farming is the most complex business in America.  I truly believe that, given all of the issues that you in agriculture either, in whatever area or connection you have with agriculture, I'm sure you appreciate that.   
The President last February established the rural council.  And it was the first time in the history of our country that a President had signed an executive order directing his cabinet members to form as a group to have a conversation and to have discussions about the state of rural America, and to work together in an integrated and more coordinated fashion to provide help and assistance to rural America.    
The President was aware of the demographic challenges that rural America has faced.  He was aware of the fact that the census now tells us that the percentage of people living in rural America is at it's lowest percent of this country's population in our history.   
I think the President also understood and appreciated the tremendous contribution that rural America makes to the rest of the country, one that frankly is often underappreciated by the rest of the country.    
He understood, as we all do, that it is the source of most of what we consume in terms of food.  It is a significant percentage of the water that we use for a variety of purposes.  It is the source of an ever increasing amount of the energy that this country will need to fuel its future.  And as he often is reminded by me, it is also the source of a disproportionate number of our military.    
The value system of this country is rooted in these rural communities, and in these farms and ranches of America.  And as a result, the President asked his cabinet members to really take a concerted look at what needed to happen in rural America in order for there to be opportunities for families to stay together, if you will, in these rural communities.   
We focus our efforts in four areas.  We focus on capital investment, on innovation, on strong communities, and on making sure that we do the very best job of conserving our natural resources.    
Now, I tell you that because the work that you are about to engage in is in a sense part of that effort to ensure that there is viable opportunities and options for people who live in rural communities, people who want to live and raise their families in areas, small towns.  
While I grew up originally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, I spent a good part of my professional life in a small town in southeast Iowa, married to a native of that small town, and got to know and to love the people of that small town.  You know, it is difficult for me on a Friday night in the fall not to want to be in the stands of the Mount Pleasant Panther football team to watch them play.  So I've substituted Friday night reruns for that endeavor.  It's the kind of sense of community and connection that I felt when I lived and worked and served people in Mount Pleasant.   
These areas of our country are challenged.  And they are challenged because of the changing aspects and nature of agriculture.  When you consider the economics of agriculture and when you realize that in just a handful of years in my lifetime, real commodity prices have increased, so there's been a pressure placed on those who produce to produce more.   
When you look at the ag census which tells us that there are a shrinking number of production sized operators in this country, but there is an increase in the number of small operations, a significant number in the last census, over 100,000 opportunities, you see the challenge of rural America.    
How do we acknowledge the important contribution and role that production agriculture plays in the United States, the important role it plays in job creation at a time when we are dealing with a very difficult economy.  I suspect on Friday we are going to have good news in terms of agricultural exports.  Those are jobs.  Those are improved income opportunities for people in those small communities.  
At the same time, we have this great infusion of entrepreneurship and innovation to compliment the entrepreneurship and innovation of production agriculture in these small sized operations.  How do they get along?  How do they live together?  How do they work together?  How do they advance the opportunities in rural America together?    
That's why you are here, to help us figure that out.    
Each of you comes to this particular conversation, I know, from potentially a particular point of view or a particular experience in your lifetime that you bring to this table.  And we made a concerted effort to try to create an AC21 committee that was representative of America, representative of the diversity of America, representative of the diversity of thought and attitudes about agriculture at every level in this country.    
And as you learn about each other, I think you'll find that we did a pretty good job of putting all of the thought processes and all of the viewpoints at the table.    
We did this in an effort to really try to create a group of people who would find that elusive answer to some questions that we have been dealing with and grappling with in the countryside and in USDA for quite some time.   
Now, we don't expect you to answer every question in the area of biotechnology and organics and sustainable agriculture, however you define those terms.  We don't expect you to do that.  We know that that's a pretty heavy task.   
So we're going to charge you with a very specific responsibility at the outset.  And there is a though process and a rationale behind that specific charge.  Let me say that given the challenges that are faced in rural America, given the significant role that agriculture plays generally in our economy, in our energy future, in our environment, these conversations are extremely important, extremely important.    
And it is absolutely, in my view, necessary for some group of people representing all interests to figure out where that consensus point is.  And our hope is that you are that group.  So here is the charge, and it's pretty specific.  There are three separate issues here.    
The first issue is, you know, as we deal with this variety of technologies that are available, and variety of methods of production, there can be circumstances potentially where those methods create some challenge.  It may be that there may be a circumstance and situation where a grower has opted to utilize one form or another of agriculture, and that that form is compromised in part by something that occurs outside of his or her operation.   
		And so the question then becomes, what types of compensation mechanisms, if any, would be appropriate to address the economic losses by farmers where the value of their crops is reduced by unintended presence of GE materials?  Are there compensation mechanisms that would make sense?  And if there are, what do they look like?  
The second issue would be, if you got compensation mechanisms, how would you go about implementing those mechanisms?  What would be necessary to implement those mechanisms?  Would there be an eligibility standard for our loss?  What tools or triggers would you use?  What measurements?  What testing procedures, tolerance levels, et cetera, would be needed to verify and measure a loss and determine if a claim was compensatible or not?  
Those are the first two questions that need to be dealt with by this committee.  Once you've sort of dealt with those two questions, then you can go to a third question which is, in addition to those mechanisms that you've identified, what other actions do you deem, would you deem appropriate to bolster or facilitate this capacity for folks to get along in the countryside, even though they are using different agricultural production systems?  
Now, there may be a tendency on the part of folks on this committee to go to number three first.  Here is why we don't want you to do that.  That's a very complex set of conversations.  And if we had all the time in the world we might let you do that.  But we don't have all the time in the world.  We have a relatively short window of opportunity here for a conversation of this significance, and we'd like to have something concrete come from it.    
The second reason, and probably the more important reason is, this conversation may take you in a variety of different directions, and what we're really trying to establish is, if there is a mechanism available for compensation, then that will lead you to further conversations about how you would ultimately implement such a system, which in turn establishes the parameters for acceptable or unacceptable risk.   
Those parameters are important, I think, for informing the third question or the third charge.  Once you have the parameters of acceptable and unacceptable risk, whatever they may be based on the mechanisms that you all talk about, then you can then begin having a conversation about how you would mitigate or reduce or alter or modify those risks.    
But until you've got the parameters, it's really, really difficult to have that conversation.  We've tried to have that conversation for the last two and a half years.  When I say we I mean, we, the collective agricultural we.  We've tried to have that conversation.  And unless I missed it, we didn't get to an answer.   
So this is a very specific charge, and a very specific responsibility we're asking you to embrace, which is, is there a compensation mechanism or mechanisms, plural?  If so, how would you implement them?  And once you've established that, that will help inform any further conversation about other steps that could potentially be taken that will allow folks to get along.    
Now, if I were on this committee, the first thing I would ask is, well, what if we come up with something that currently isn't allowed to be done?  I don't want you to be limited in your thought process about what the statutes or the regulations may or may not be.  I want you to come up with an appropriate mechanism.  And then we'll try to figure out what has to happen, if anything.    
It may very well be that we have existing authorities that can be utilized.  It may be that we have existing authorities that could be modified through regulation.  It may be that we require statutory changes.  But whatever we need to do, it will be helpful to note what it is so that we can then ask the appropriate authorities for permission to proceed.    
I don't want you to have to worry about whether or not you need an act of Congress, or you need a regulatory change, or you need some kind of construct that, in your view, may be difficult to establish or to achieve.  That should not govern how you all ultimately come to conclusions.  
If you were looking at it that way, I think it would make it that much more difficult for you to come to a resolution.  So don't worry about the mechanism.  There are risk management tools.  There are a variety of other things that could potentially be utilized.  It just depends on where you all end, and then we'll figure out what we have to do to make it happen.    
We will probably charge you later in terms of when we'd like to see a final product.  I'm not \-- Michael, do we have a deadline yet?    
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. VILSACK:  Okay.  So to show you why we think this is a constrained situation in terms of time, we think you have opportunity to meet potentially four times, three times to have a conversation and discussion, three times in addition to this, at which point at the end of that third meeting you should have some idea of whether or not you can reach any degree of consensus on it, and if so, what that consensus might be.  And so it's a relatively short time line.    
We will all try to deal with schedules.  We can use technology to link folks who, for whatever reason, can't make it to an in-person meeting.  But I think it's important that you understand this is not something that's going to linger for a considerable period of time.    
You all come to this table with an understanding, a basic understanding of many of the issues.  And I think it's important and necessary for you to really get to the business of trying to figure this out.   
Let me stop by ending where I started which is to thank you for your willingness to do this.  I fully appreciate, fully appreciate, having been the subject of many blog posts, how difficult this all is.  It's not an easy topic.  It's not an easy issue.  But it is one of the most important things that's going to be discussed in this building in the time I'm here.  Of that I am convinced.  And it may be one of the most important things to have been discussed in this building for a long, long, long, long time.   
And at the end of the day what motivates me is the opportunity to revitalize the rural economy.  That's what motivates me, recognizing the contribution that currently is being made by a lot of good hard working people, whether it's in production agriculture or any other form of agriculture.    
I have no favorite here, you all may.  I do not.  I don't have that luxury.  I respect and I use this word advisingly, and I love those people who are working the farms, fields, and ranches, regardless of what type of operation they have, because I know the contribution they make to my family every day.  I know the contribution they make to this country every day.  And I know that they often feel underappreciated by people like me.    
So I have no favorites.  I just want to find consensus.  And I have an unfailing confidence and belief that people who are smart and reasonable and who are willing to listen and willing to work together can find a solution because that's the way it happens in small towns across the country.   
When there's a conflict or a problem, it's usually folks getting together in a community meeting and working it out.  So I believe in that value.  So with that, let me open it up.  I've got a few, five-ten minutes for questions, and then I've got to unfortunately leave to go look at disaster stuff.  Yes, sir.   
MR. CORZINE:  Well, Mr. Secretary, Leon Corzine from Assumption, Illinois.  And I want to thank you, first off, for your presence and for reconvening the AC21, and also for the appointment.  It's very important for our future, as you have stated very well.  
 		My son, who is our sixth generation, is pretty much running the farm now, and I help out.  And he understands the importance of this as well as my wife.  And that's why they allowed me to leave the fields of central Illinois to be here for a couple of days.   
Also, I'm near the farm progress show, which is going on, and I know with your schedule you may not be able to be there with what's going on, but I am sure USDA will have a good presence, and we're expecting a good show.   So thank you very much, and this is extremely important for us for our future and what we're going to be doing on the farm for the next 10 to 20 years.   
MR. VILSACK:  Is that farm progress show better in Illinois or when it's in Boone, Iowa?  
MR. CORZINE:  Well, let's see.  The neat thing is, I think each state tries to outdo the other as we go along.  And they have continued to improve.  And the weather is really good this time, so a lot of times mother nature who is the one that really determines how good a show, as far as what we are able to see happen in the fields.  
MR. VILSACK:  It's a great show.  It's a great show.  
MR. MATLOCK:  The complexity of this issue is dramatic.  So how deep in the weeds do you want us to go in those first two questions?  
MR. VILSACK:  My expectation is that you come up with a recommendation about what you think the world, or the way the world ought to be.  Not the way the world is, but the way the world ought to be, which is why I understand and appreciate the complexity of it.    
But again, I'm not sure that it's an impossible task.  I wouldn't be asking you if I thought it was impossible.  I think it is possible.  It will take some creativity and some innovation and problem solving, but I think you can come to a conclusion in this group representing many, many interests, and then we'll determine how we might be able to go about making that happen.    
But absent it, absent that solution, absent this conversation, what you're going to have is the continuation of what we have today.  And the continuation of what we have today, and some of you have heard this before, is a circumstance where within agriculture there is a struggle and it takes energy and time and effort and resources away from communicating to the other 99 and a half percent of the public that benefits from what happens in our agricultural fields, but has no clue how important it is to their life, and often takes it totally for granted.    
And if we want to change policy generally for rural America, if we want to get and to ensure that there is adequate investment in the infrastructure and all the things that are important to economic activity and community life, you've got to have the rest of the country paying attention, a little more attention to rural America.  Well, you can't do that if you are fighting with each other.  I'm not sure who put their card up first, but go ahead.  
MS. MARTENS:  Mary-Howell Martens from upstate New York.  A farmer, yes, but an organic farmer, farmer first.  And if you are coming up to see, if you are going to see disasters, you may very well be heading up to the northeast because we are, parts of the northeast is definitely a disaster right now from the hurricane.  But unfortunately, we're not the only area in the country that is suffering from disasters.    
And my sense is, as farmers, there are just too many pressures against us.  The last thing we need in rural America is to turn one farmer, one neighbor against another over this issue.  If we can find ways in our communities not to have this be a divisive issue, we'll be so much better off.  So I appreciate what you are trying to do here, and as an organic farmer I am definitely on your side.    
MR. VILSACK:  What part of upstate New York are you?  
MS. MARTENS:  Penn Yan \-- area.  
MR. VILSACK:  Okay.  I went to school at Hamilton College in upstate New York.   
MS. MARTENS:  It's a beautiful place.    
MR. VILSACK:  Okay.  
MR. IHNEN:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for the invitation to participate in this.  First and most important question, how is your nephew doing?    
MR. VILSACK:  We have an interesting conversation.  Darrin's son is in the Marine Corps and served overseas in Afghanistan.  And my nephew is in the Marine Corps, and he may very well today be on his way to Afghanistan.  My nephew is an explosives expert.    
This is a 19-year-old kid who has been taught how to blow the doors off of places that may be housing folks that we don't necessarily like.  And he tried to reassure his mother that it was a safer occupation than being the first one in the door after it's blown off, but I don't think his mother was convinced, and certainly his uncle wasn't.  But thanks for asking.   
MR. IHNEN:  I guess one followup.  I know you are headed down to North Carolina, and we've got some growers in that area that have 20 inches of rain.  They've got wet corn in the bins, no electricity.  And so again, just to reiterate the importance of crop insurance and risk management, and just appreciate the efforts that you've been able to help in that area.  
MR. VILSACK:  You know, I appreciate that comment, and you're right, crop insurance is extraordinarily important.  I probably should have said this at the outset, but your question allows me to sort of amplify.  Unless you haven't been following this, this may not be news, but in the event you haven't been following the papers, I got a news flash for you.  We're going to have a lot less resources to deal with at the USDA.  And I mean a lot less.   
When folks talk about trillion dollars of cuts, you know, it's hard for individuals to get their arms around what that means.  But I've been dealing the last several days with the actual numbers for this department.    
We had a 10 percent reduction as a result of the continuing resolution which we had to implement in about five months, so it was almost as if it was a 20 percent cut.  And the house has just passed a, before they went on recess, they passed a budget that would cut our budget another 13 percent.  And that's before the super-committee of 12 begins taking a whack at various programs.  
This gets back to the point of, we're a relatively small percentage of the country, relatively small percentage of \-- the farmers, farmers are a relatively small percentage of the population.  We have really much bigger battles, in a sense, to fight in terms of being able to preserve the investment in rural America.  This is going to be hard.    
Now, crop insurance is one area where we fortunately have already saved money by renegotiating with the insurance companies, but it's, and it's a very important tool, significant tool.  But frankly, it works for some better than for others.  And we've got to figure that out if we're going to make that one of our principal safety net components.  It's great for folks in the midwest.  It's not so good for folks in upstate New York.    
MR. BENBROOK:  Charles Benbrook.  Glad to be here, and thanks for taking this on.  I had the pleasure to try to help out with that roundup ready alfalfa working group that you spent a lot of time with in December and January.  And I think we made some good progress there, and I hope we can build from that foundation.   
It seems to me there's two things that strike me as someone who's sort of been a part of this debate for almost 20 years now.  One is that AC21 is kind of the only policy game in town dealing with all of the issues around agricultural biotechnology.  And I think there is going to be an inevitable effort by a lot of people to bring all of the issues that are on the table to this process to try to find a way through the work of AC21 to deal with this much broader laundry list of concerns and tensions about ag biotech.   
And I think that whatever you can do, and the department can do to create more appropriate fora for some of these other issues to get dealt with, it will make it more manageable for us to deal with the core issues that you'd like to see AC21 deal with.  I mean, we just, we can't ignore this set of other issues.  They are going to continue to come up.  And to the extent that some progress is made in dealing with them, it's going to make our job easier.   
And you broke some of that in the announcement in January where you started, restarted the germ plasm committee, which I think was a very positive thing.  So I think I'd keep your eye on that ball because there are other, certainly other big issues that need to be dealt with.  
The other thing that strikes me to really talk about compensation mechanisms and dealing with the economic tensions that are out there about ag biotech, it's really, I think it will be helpful for us to break it down into some of its component parts.  I think there is a very important cluster of issues that arise mostly within the seed industry and that relate to seed purity and the management of how seed gets managed and impacted by agriculture biotechnology.   
I think there is a cluster of issues that you've certainly talked about a lot that, you know, production agriculture, you know, farmers that are growing crops.  They're not in the seed business, but they're growing crops and they need to access markets and there are certainly a set of issues and mechanisms, hopefully, that can deal with that.  
And then last there is the economic risk that the sector as a whole, or a major food brand space, you know, the sort of thing that's happened in the wake of Liberty Link and StarLink and brands that, you know, brands that get impacted by ag biotech.    
And that's another cluster of economic impacts that, I think, require a different mechanism than what may be needed on the farm, in the farm sector, what may be needed in the seed industry.  So I hope, I hope that we can break this problem down into some more manageable parts and talk about the solutions in that way.   
MR. VILSACK:  Yes.  That's a very constructive comment, and it's, I think it underscores why the charge that we've given is very specific, and why we've prioritized the charge.  I guess my view is that we've begun that process of breaking these things down into smaller pieces.  
Given the complexity, given the passions, given the emotions that are engaged and involved in this discussion, and the importance of it, our view is that let's take one bite at a time.  Let's see how this works.  You're right, we have reconstituted the germ plasm committee, which is a much more technical committee.    
We've also engaged the seed industry in conversations around the protection of the seed, the patent protection, if you will, that seed companies have.  And how does that work?  And what happens when these patents expire?  
And where are we headed?  Do we have a game plan?  Do we have a sense of where that's all headed?    
We also will be challenged in terms of budgets because of the research aspect of this as it continues to be an important consideration.  And so what we will be forced to do in tight budgets is to really focus on core competencies.  What is it that USDA does better than anybody else in the country, can do or does do?    
And that's really what we should continue to do.  And everything else that we do not as well as other folks, maybe somebody else should do it.  So we're engaged right now in a very significant conversation within the halls of this building about precisely what that new, modern, USDA looks like in a constrained resource environment.    
And I honestly believe that, you know, with some innovative and creative thought, we actually can leverage our dollars more effectively than we have in the past.  So we entered into, for example, recently, a memorandum of understanding with the council on foundations.    
You know, one would not think of the USDA and foundations in the same thought, but our view is that if you are interested in rural development, foundations are sitting on a trillion dollars in assets, where do they invest those assets?  How much of those, of their portfolio is invested in rural development, and can we convince them to maybe inch that up a bit?  
When they make grants, can we figure out how their grants and our grants can be integrated and coordinated in a fashion that actually moves the dial a little bit further,  
it moves the ball down the field a little bit farther than it is moving.    
So there are ways in a constrained environment, you know, as my staff has heard me talk on a number of occasions, you know, there are two ways to look at this budget cutting stuff.  One is to be depressed by it, and to realize how difficult and challenging it is and how many lives are going to get, you know, disrupted because of it.   
That's a very depressing set of thoughts, and frankly, it doesn't motivate you to want to do anything.  And it sort of paralyzes you.   The other way is to say, you know, this USDA was founded 149 years ago.  We're going to celebrate our 150th birthday.  Maybe this is an opportunity for us to modernize this department, really bring it into the 21st century, better utilize technology, be more creative with our resources, focus on resources that we really own, if you will.  And as a result, do a better job and maybe even do a better job even with fewer resources.   
And that's a much more hopeful and optimistic way of looking at this.  And frankly, it's one that you can kind of get your arms around and get excited about, and as difficult as this challenge will be.  
So I see this as part of that creative process, and I see this as a way in which I bring, you know, you all have a phenomenal backgrounds.  I'm sure you're going to go around and introduce yourselves to each other, and you're going to go, man, it's a pretty impressive group of people from all over the country, from all walks, you know, all aspects of this conversation.  If you guys can't get this done, if you guys can't get this done, who can?  I'm betting on you.    
And I think the countryside is betting on you.  And the country needs you to get to \-- needs you to get to yes.  So we'll have an opportunity to visit again.  And I apologize, but this is a command performance, so I've got to go.  Thank you all.    
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  I knew there would be awkward moments as chairman.  Staff in knowing that he had a tight schedule here today to keep, but I knew he stepped out, but I just want to say thank you to the Secretary again for reconvening the committee, and extend, as he did, appreciation to each of you for taking on this collective challenge.   
You're in a special place with special responsibilities, and I think hearing the Secretary, each time I do, sort of underscore, you know, the value of rural America, the value of agriculture, the importance of it, is helpful, you know, because we can all sort of fall into these narrow conversations about what we do in our own piece of this industry, and our own piece of this economy.    
But it's good to hear that we have a shared responsibility to each other, and from the Secretary's perspective, what he now expects in terms of a committee I think is quite helpful.   
There was a comment made earlier about farmers and the value of farmers and the value of agriculture, the Secretary said it, and some of you have said that as well. 			You know, so many times we, in an industry, and this comes from my former life as a secretary, you know, when agriculture feeds on agriculture, nothing good happens.  Nothing good happens.  I've watched it time and again, and believe strongly that anybody who is prepared to step into this conversation about feeding a population, feeding America, needs to be honored for that.   
And yes, they have different approaches to production.  That is part of our diversity, and is part of our strength.  It's very important that we honor that.  
Now, how do we manage that I think is what we are talking about here through this committee.  But I really hope that the conversations continue as they have the first hour here and the value of the Secretary's perspective as well.  So again, thank you to each of you.  I look forward to this conversation over the next couple of days.  Michael.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Thank you.  I think we were probably, we were all very pleased to hear the clear remarks from the Secretary.  What I'd like to do is to hop back into where my introductory remarks were going to be before the schedule change, and tell you a little more about how the committee meeting is going to run.  Can you hear me in the other room okay?  I see a head shaking.  Good.   
I'd like to note first off that in addition to having just heard the Secretary, we are privileged to also have tomorrow morning the Deputy Secretary coming in to speak to further spear this committee's efforts.    
I should mention we have several other USDA officials and appointees in attendance.  At the moment I see we have Deputy Undersecretary Enright and a special assistant former AFIS Administrator Cindy Smith, and I think others came in and came out, also, a special assistant, Karen Wilcox, in research education environment back there.   
In addition, we have a transcriptionist recording this meeting.  And in addition, we have Dick George from AFIS who is here helping our process by taking notes throughout the meeting.  Thank you for coming, Dick.  We appreciate the work.    
We'll have a very full agenda, so we ask that when the meeting is in session, conversations need to be limited to those between members.  The public will be invited to participate by providing comments to the committee and USDA this afternoon between 3:15 and 5:00 p.m.    
Members of the public who are listening to the proceedings in the overflow room next door and wish to speak, please be sure that you have signed up on the comment list just outside the door so that we can have you come up to the microphone to speak at the appropriate time.  I apologize for not being able to accommodate you directly in the meeting room for this first meeting.  We have had some requirements for where we hold the first meeting with the Secretary and the Deputy.   
We will be preparing the minutes of this meeting and the computer transcript will be available on the committee's website within a few weeks.  We hope to get the minutes and all the meeting announcements up on the web, and the advisory committee website is being revised to make all of that happen.   
At the break I will write up the committee website address on the flip chart here which doesn't roll drippingly off the tongue, so I won't try to say it, but it's very easy to access if you go to the main USDA website at www.USDA.gov, click on biotechnology, and then you will see a link for this committee that you can go to directly from there.   
For members of the press, you are welcome to speak to whomever you wish during the breaks of our meeting and before or after the meeting itself.  But we ask that you not conduct any interviews or request comments from members while the AC21 is actually in session.  Mr. Redding, our chair, and I will be available for questions and comments at the end of each day of the meeting.  
A few housekeeping matters, we also request that all members of the AC21, as well as all members of the audience and the press, please shut off your cell phones and your beepers, if you should still have such things, while you are in the room.  They interfere with the microphones and they interfere with the recording of the meeting which we're doing in order to produce the meeting transcript.   
Bathrooms are located on either side of the patio, the indoor patio just outside this room.   
One other really important but prosaic matter, members, you all have tent cards in front of your place.  When you wish to be recognized, as folks have already done, please turn them on end.  Also, because you have an audience listening in the other room, and you have transcribers who are trying to figure out who talks, please identify yourself when called on to speak.   
Ex officio members who are sitting on the side, and I'd like to welcome the three ex officio members who are here today, please raise your hand when you wish to speak.  There is a wireless mike that you can pass between you that's on the chair at the right, at your right.   
Just outside the meeting room there's a table with documents.  On that table you will find copies of the official meeting documents.  Please take only one copy.    
For members of the public who wish to speak during the public comment period, I will need hard copies of your remarks and an electronic copy of those remarks so that we can post them on the committee website.    
We'll talk about the handouts a little bit later in the morning, but I will note that you will find copies of a detailed meeting agenda.  And for those who may have received earlier copies of the agenda, even the earlier one mid-day yesterday for committee members, please note that the one that is out there which accommodated some last minute schedule changes is slightly different from the one that you got mid-day yesterday.   
Please note that there are breaks scheduled this morning and afternoon.  I'd like to repeat again that we are planning for public comment this afternoon from 3:15 to 5:00.  We would like folks who are going to sign up, to sign up early.  We want to be responsible for, responsive to the needs of the public, and will see as the meeting progresses how we need to structure that time.  I can assure you that one way or another we will find a way to use the time.   
For members who wish to sign up and deliver comments, you will each have five timed minutes to deliver your comments.  Your work is going to affect many areas of activities within USDA and we're awaiting your work with great anticipation.    
As the Secretary indicated, based on what I know about the complexities of the issues, and the range of views that are represented here, your work is going to be challenging and exciting.  You will have a very full agenda, which I'll talk about in more detail a little bit later in the next two days.    
We hope to establish at this meeting the foundation for working together with the leadership of the chair, and we will explore what's possible and practical for strengthening coexistence among agricultural production methods within the framework of the charge that you just heard.  
I'd like to emphasize, this is not a discussion of one form of agriculture versus another.  This is about the future of all forms of agricultural production, biotech coexisting with other biotech, with non-GE, with organic, all, and all of the various permutations of that for the future of agriculture.  
You have USDA's commitment and my commitment to do whatever we can to make your work a success.  So let me welcome you again and thank you for your willingness to engage in this effort.  You will each have opportunities to say a few words about yourself in a few minutes.    
But now let me turn back to the chair, if he has any further words, I'm delighted to welcome you a little bit more slowly, and thank you for the energy, the commitment, the knowledge of how to deal with public meetings that you are going to bring to this discussion.  Russell.   
MR. REDDING:  Michael, thank you.  And again, just I'm honored to be here and be asked, quite frankly, to be in this conversation.  It's one of those that, you know, I think each of us share because we've signed on, but really trying to find some solutions going forward.   
We know that we've got a list, Mr. Benbrook, you've identified very nicely.  There are those things that this is the vehicle.  But we're going to have to sort of put those aside and come back to them, but not lose sight of them either.  
So with that, why don't we do a quick round of introductions and then by \-- sorry.    
MR. BENBROOK:  The schedule.  The name is Benbrook.  A question.  Michael, the Secretary said, we have three meetings after this one to try to wrestle these issues to the ground.  Michael, in what time frame would you imagine these three meetings to occur in?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  I think the expectation is that the committee is going to meet four times per year, so that's sort of roughly every three months we'll have a meeting which means that the \-- this is the beginning of September.    
So essentially one more this year, sort of late November, early December is probably the next meeting that we'll have.  It takes a bit of time to get these organized, to get the documents out, to get the summaries, to have work groups if they are formed, meet intercessionally.  So we'll talk about all of that a little bit later.    
But the idea is that we might have three more meetings for discussing this topic, then the chair and I will get together to try to prepare a summary of what we heard from the recommendations from this committee.  We'll have a meeting to discuss that.  We'll go over the details of all of that much more when we discuss the Bylaws a little bit later, a little bit later today, and how we've revised those.    
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Thank you.  Let's do a quick round of introductions.  I ask just name and sort of where you are from.  If you've had an affiliation with the committee before, please note that.  Just very quickly, give us a sketch of your background and we'll do a quick round of introductions.    
You'll notice on the agenda we'll take a break and we'll come back, and the committee will then, we can pick up on the conversation.  And I'd like to have some reaction within that block of time, sort of what the Secretary has laid out with a charge for us.  But let's begin with introductions.   
MR. ANDERSON:  I'm Paul Anderson.  I'm director of international programs at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis.  We are charged with helping to improve food security crops, staple crops for developing countries.  Mostly work in Africa, crops like casava and sweet potato, a heavy emphasis on nutritional value improvement.  I'm a biochemist by training.  I've spent my career in crop improvement area.   
MS. BATCHA:  I'm Laura Batcha.  And I'm with the Organic Trade Association, and we represent about 6,500 certified organic operations across North America.  And our members include everything from producers to handlers, processors, manufacturers, exporters, importers, retailers, and certifiers, so the entire production and agricultural food supply chain for organic products.    
Personally, I have been involved in organic agriculture for over 20 years and live on a small farm that is currently flooded in southern Vermont, with my husband, and left there yesterday morning with the power out and everything under water.  So we'll see what reports come in through the day, but pleased to be here.  
MR. SLOCUM:  Amd I'm Jerry Slocum.  I farm in the northwestern corner of Mississippi, primarily wheat and soybeans and corn now.  We were cotton farmers for almost 100 years and we quit that back in the nineties when the farm policies changed.   
I was on the previous AC21 and before that, the ACAB that was in Mr. Glickman's tenure as Secretary.  So I've had some experience dealing with biotech issues in this environment in Washington.  But I do look forward to this task, Mr. Chairman, because it's a little bit more specific than the previous task that the committee's dealt with.  So you've got your work cut out for you.   
MR. MATLOCK:  Yes, I think that's we.  Marty Matlock.  I am the University of Arkansas, professor of ecological engineering, chair of the Center for Ag and Rural Sustainability.  Our charge is to enhance rural prosperity.  
I serve the citizens of Arkansas.  We're the third or fourth most impoverished state in the nation, depending on what matrix you use.  We're a rural producing state, and there seems to be an unfortunate correlation between that and poverty.  That seems to be global as well.    
If nine and a quarter billion people come to dinner in the next 40 years, and they are all going to be wanting better and higher food chain foods.  So the future for agriculture has never been more positive, in my perspective, and never more challenging as well because of the input costs and products that we need.   
I am also on the executive committee for the  Field to Market Keystone Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture, technical advisor for the Stewardship Index for Specialty Crops and a senior research advisor for the Sustainability Consortium.  We work in metrics for sustainability.  
MR. KISLING:  I'm Keith Kisling from Oklahoma, a full-time farmer and rancher.  I raise wheat, wheat, pasture cattle in the fall and the spring of the year.  We also raise alfalfa and some corn.  I'm past chairman of U.S. Wheat.  I was in the leadership of U.S. Wheat for four years, traveled extensively, 17 countries, some of them multiple times to see exactly what our importers are wanting overseas in the way of wheat, particularly.    
I started out in '02 as chairman of a committee in Egypt to see what biotech wheat was going to do overseas.  I have seen the progression and the need of that process throughout the world in the last eight years.  So I'm hoping that I can bring some expertise to this committee on overseas travels, and where it started and where it's at now.   
MR. REDDING:  Excellent.  Welcome.   
MR. KISLING:  Thanks for an invitation to be on this committee.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Chuck Benbrook.  I'm the chief scientist of the Organic Center, which is a small nonprofit that tries to track and integrate science coming out around the world on the consumer health benefits and environmental benefits of organic food and farming.    
I've been involved in the assessment of agricultural biotechnology really going back to about 1980 when I worked for the Congress and one of the subcommittees of the house ag committee.    
And over the period when these technologies have come into the marketplace, I have carried out a number of different analytical tasks and trying to understand the science behind GE crops and how a wide range of policies have affected the evolution of that technology and the way that it has come to impact in such dramatic ways the economics of agriculture production and the environmental impacts of certainly corn and soybean production, and cotton.    
And I guess I have been, I've been in the middle of a number of the debates for a long, long time, and I certainly share with the Secretary a deep concern about how profoundly important those debates are, and that they need to, American agriculture needs to work through some of the fundamental issues or they are really going to tear us up.   
MR. REDDING:  That's good.  Thank you.   
MR. KEMPER:  Thank you and good morning.  I'm Alan Kemper, Kemper Farms, Lafayette, Indiana.  We have been in existence since 1888 on the family farming traditions.  I've served on numerous trade policy advisory committees to the Secretary and USTR over the years in this room and others here in Washington, D.C. with that.  I served on President Clinton's Sustainable Agricultural Development Council for a few years, also.  So thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I look forward to our engagement.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.   
MR. GOEHRING:  Good morning, Doug Goehring.  I am a producer/farmer, been involved in production agriculture all my life, from south central North Dakota.  I also have the honor and the privilege of serving as the State's North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner also.  I've had the chance to serve with you also, Russ, and I appreciate the opportunity to watch you serve as chair on this committee.    
I have had the opportunity also to make sure, and I do this quite often, representing all aspects of production agriculture in my state.  We actually grow about 35 different crops.  14 of those are number one in the production, or at least we produce 14 of those that are number one in the production of the United States, such as spring wheat, durum, flax, canola, various other crops that are also.   
So I have been involved in some of these discussions about coexistence and also had the opportunity back in December to be involved when we had the discussion about Roundup ready alfalfa.  And the reason I was probably inserted into that conversation is simply because of the compensation aspect of what I brought to the table concerning an insurance product that could help maybe remedy some of the conversation and the discussion that did take place.    
We pursued some of that as a committee, didn't have a chance to move forward with it.  This may be a good opportunity at this meeting for us to talk about it.  I can share some of those things.  I look at this in a very simplistic fashion, as a farmer myself.  I've also been a seed producer.    
So to me, I look at seed production as being a way to resolve or talk about this issue, to have that dialogue, simply because we have a system, a structure, and practices in place that can help us really design a model based much after what's already in place and working in production agriculture.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  Very good.  Thank you.  Welcome.   
MS. WILSON:  Thank you.  Dr. Latresia Wilson.  I'm from Ocala, Florida, and I am vice president of the State Chapter of Florida for the Black Farmers and Agriculturalist Association.  And again, I want to thank you for having us to have a seat at the table.  
My background is not too much in farming, however, I grew up on a farm and I later, in subsequent years, I've gone from nuclear engineering, and now I'm an emergency medicine physician, so I have a variety of experiences, and I think I have something to offer here though.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  That's excellent.  Thank you.   
MR. BUSS:  Good morning.  I'm  Darryl Buss.  I am dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  Prior to veterinary medicine, I was raised on a family farm in southwestern, Minnesota, and that farm remains in operation under the direction of my nephew at this point.  
MR. REDDING:  We're getting signals in the back.  You can't hear?  Is that \--   
MR. BUSS:  Okay.  As I'm sure you know, agriculture and agri-business continues to be by a large segment, the largest factor in the Wisconsin State economy.  And the questions we've been asked to deal with are certainly important ones to us.    
MS. ANDALUZ:  Good morning.  My name is Isaura Andaluz.  I'm from Albuquerque, New Mexico.  I do \--   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  They can't hear.  Can you speak up a little?  
MS. ANDALUZ:  It's on.  Okay.  Now can you hear me?  No, yes?    
MR. REDDING:  This way it's fine.  It seems like the public space may be \--   
(Discussion off the record.)   
MS. ANDALUZ:  Okay.  Good morning.  My name is Isaura Andaluz.  I'm from Albuquerque, New Mexico.  I work as a community economic development consultant in New Mexico.  I've been a farmer.  I'm also a beekeeper.  And I work with smaller farmers in New Mexico trying to bring back native crops from seeds that have been growing there for hundreds of years, and make them profitable.  And also we are trying to bring back the seed protection business as well.  
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.    
MR. CORZINE:  Good morning.  I'm Leon Corzine.  I farm with my family at Assumption, Illinois, which is pretty close to the center of the State of Illinois.  I am fifth generation on our farm, so my son, the sixth generation, is what has allowed me to be involved in the things that you can read through in the biography.   
Having that next generation there, and being with my father before we lost him helps us take a look at the future.  And my dad was pretty innovative.  We did a lot of things in specialty grains in the sixties, and the segregation issues and what it took to do some of those things.  We currently do some seed production as well.  As you mentioned, I think that's a model that we can look at as we work through this.   
I also, as we look at the future and the importance, and the importance of agriculture, and it's certainly been a bright spot, and we have to keep that going.  And the issues that I really look forward to this because this is the place to have the discussion.  And agriculture needs to work together.  And so many demands and opportunities for us in the future.    
So I certainly welcome this challenge and remember that my family back home is what \-- I have to get permission these days to leave.  And actually I've been home a little more.  So I think maybe they were ready for me to leave for a few days.  That sometimes happens as well, because I spend a lot of time on the biotech issues with the National Corn Growers Association.  I was our biotech working group chair back in some of those times when we were setting a lot of the pathway for corn innovation to come forward in the late nineties and early 2000's.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Welcome.   
MS. LEWIS:  Good morning.  I'm Josette Lewis.  I'm with Arcadia Biosciences.  We are a small agriculture biotechnology company located in California.  And we develop both genetically engineered as well as non-genetically engineered traits for a broad variety of crops.  And we've licensed our technologies for all of the major commodities, as well as a number of small specialty markets, as well as overseas.    
We have experience first hand a lot of the controversy around genetically engineer traits, as we have worked extensively, for example, with our California rice growers around trying to find the appropriate mechanisms for us to field trial genetically engineered rice, respecting their market concerns, which most people are aware of the rice controversy.  So that's something we take very seriously.   
We work extensively with wheat growers as we look at the potential to bring both transgenic and non-transgenic traits forward in wheat.  So we take quite seriously the need to service the diversity of agriculture.   
And it's very important to our company as a smaller sized company that we can also see a diversity of technology providers for both transgenic and non-transgenic trades.  So that is that avenue forward for us as well.    
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Thank you.   
MR. FUNK:  Hello.  I'm Michael Funk.  I'm the founder and chairman of UNFI, United Natural Foods.  I started in the mid-seventies picking fruit in the Sacramento Valley where I live, and today our company is the world's largest wholesale distributor of natural and organic foods, a $5 billion dollar publically traded company.  
 		I'm also president of the Non-GMO Project, a nonprofit voluntary labeling initiative that the organic and natural food industry has instituted in the last few years.  We have experience with setting a standard for non-GMO compliance, dealing with thresholds and testing protocols.  And we currently have about 5,000 products participating in that.  So I look forward to our discussions.    
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.    
MS. OLSEN:  Good morning everyone.  My name is Angela Olsen and I'm a senior advisor and associate general counsel at Dupont Pioneer.  As you may know, we sell seeds and we sell biotech, conventional, and organic seeds.  So this conversation is extremely important to us, both as a company, as an industry, but as a country as well.    
I actually started my career as a bench scientist.  So I am a scientist at heart and spent many years as a scientist.  Was then a college professor.  Had my own communications firm dealing with scientific issues, and breaking down complex scientific issues both for publication but also for public consumption, depending on the audience. Then later went to law school and have worked on coexistence issues for many, many years.  It's an area that I enjoy.    
Probably most importantly what I bring to this discussion is an open mind.  I look for \-- I really want to hear everybody's perspective.  I look forward to a robust discussion.  And mostly look forward to rolling up my sleeves and working.    
This is going to be hard work for all of us.  I know every one of us sitting at the table is very committed to this and committed to deriving solutions and giving recommendations to the Secretary.  So I look forward to working with all of you.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Welcome.  
MR. JOHNSON:  Good morning.  My name is David Johnson.  I'm assistant director of research and plant breeder with Calwith Seeds.  I'm based in Lacrosse, Wisconsin.  Calwith Seeds is a farmer owned co-op that focuses on seed production.  We do that seed production for the U.S. and for about 30 countries around the world.  We focus on forge crops.  The number one crop that we focus on is alfalfa.  We also work with red clover, white clover, sudan grass, teff grass, and safflower, an oil seed crop.   
I grew up on a wheat farm in western Nebraska.  I served as a congressional science fellow with the Senate Agricultural Committee back in 1990 to '92, and look forward to being a part of these discussions.    
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.   
MR. JAFFE:  Hi.  My name is Greg Jaffe.  I'm the director of the Biotechnology Project at the Center for Science and Public Interest.  The Center for Science and Public Interest is a nonprofit consumer organization located here in Washington, D.C.    
We've been around for about 40 years now working on food and nutrition issues on behalf of consumers, educating the public about those issues, and advocating on behalf of consumers both in Congress and federal government and actually internationally working on the range of issues from food safety to nutrition and school lunches, to establishing a national food tank this coming fall for everybody out there.   
The biotechnology project works on \-- GM foods and I've been at CSPI for almost a little more than 10 years now.  I, like Jerry, am a veteran of this committee, having worked on it for six years or so.  And I agree with Jerry that I am really pleased to get such a specific charge, which is something that I think we haven't had at the committee and something that a lot of the committee members have complained about in the past.  So I look forward to digging into that.   
Before working at CSPI, I worked in the government as an environmental attorney, both for the Department of Justice and for the Environmental Protection Agency, and bring and expertise in sort of regulation and biosafety regulation and how the government operates.  Thanks.   
MR. REDDING:  Excellent.  Welcome.   
MR. IHNEN:  Good morning, I'm Darrin Ihnen, a fourth generation farmer from Hurley, South Dakota, in the southeastern part of the state.  We raise corn, soybeans, have a large hog finishing operation.  I'm also involved with the ethanol industry, and we do export grain out of our part of the world there.  So I bring a unique perspective that I deal with all the end users.  
I'm currently chairman of the National Corn Growers Association who as an organization has 35,000 members representing another 300,000 that are due, or not dues but contribute through their checkoff.  And so the corn growers have been very active in biotechnology.  But we, as an organization, support all methods of production and have been pretty clear on that in the past, and look forward to working with this group to find solutions to some problems that we may be working towards in the future.  
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Welcome.  
MS. MARTEN:  Mary-Howell Martens.  My husband and I farm 1,400 acres of organic grain crops in upstate New York, corn, soybeans, wheat.  We are a commercial size farm, and are very committed to that.    
My day job, however, is I own and operate an organic feed and seed operation.  On our farm we are certified seed producers.  We also do kosher grain production.    
And so one of the things that I have seen is the congruency between certified seed production, kosher law, and organic certification, all of which are quality certifications.  And I think that there's a lot that we can learn from that.  
I am proud to say that I did not grow up on a farm.  I know a lot of people might not see it that way, but I think that we, in the farming community, tend to need more perspective on those of us who do come from a non-farming background.  Hybrid vigor always is good.  And we need to be able to see that other people have legitimately credible perspectives on what we are doing in agriculture.   
My background is in plant breeding.  I worked for 10 years as a plant breeder at Cornell, and there are, indeed, great varieties, great vines out in the breeding vineyards there that are transgenic, with my finger on the trigger of the gene gun.  So I do have a background in biotechnology.  I also have seen that there are other ways to farm that may address the same issues in a uniquely different way, but a very effective way.  So I like to look at the long perspective of why we're doing what we're doing to accomplish what we need to do.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.    
MS. HUGHES:  Good morning.  My name is Missy  Hughes.  I'm general counsel of CROPP Cooperative, which is based in Lafarge, Wisconsin, a small town of about 750\.  But we represent 1,600 farmers from 35 states, all organic, primarily dairy and eggs, but we also have meat and produce producers.   
I was honored and lucky to be a part of the alfalfa working group back in January with Doug and Chuck and a few others.  And I want to say that that perspective and experience showed me that people in this world are willing to, as Angela said, roll up their sleeves and work together and listen to each other.  And I look forward to that continuing with our group today.   
MR. BUSHUE:  My name is Barry Bushue.  I farm about 20 miles due east of Portland, Oregon, with my wife and children.  Actually, she does most of the work so I can come to these meetings.  But we're a very diverse horticultural operation.  We have both retail and wholesale, fruits, vegetables, pumpkins, flowers, bedding plants, and a big pumpkin patch in the fall, if my pumpkins ever turn orange.   
Representing here both myself as well as the Oregon Farm Bureau, as its president, and the American Farm Bureau Federation, as it's vice president.  I look forward to the opportunity to engage in this discussion.  I think it's critically important, and obviously Farm Bureau has a vested interest as the largest general agricultural organization in the world.  And we support and encourage all forms of agriculture and are totally supportive of coexistence.  So thank you very much for this opportunity.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Thank you.   
MR. CLARKSON:  Good morning.  My name is Lynn Clarkson.  I grew up on a farm fairly close to where Lynn Farm is today.  And continue to be a farmer raising corn, soybeans, wheat and sunflowers.   
But I'm really here because I'm president of a green company that doesn't raise corn.  We raise specific corns.  We started talking to clients that my company services, which are a number of clients in Asian countries, European countries, South American countries.  The standard question was, do you have a problem that I might be able to address?  And almost to a man or to a woman, the present food companies said, there is too much variation in incoming raw material.  We want more consistency.    
Consistency is critically important to the food industry.  It's not marginal.  We're talking about 25 percent difference in process yield between delivering a graded product and delivering an identity preserved product.   
So purity is important to everybody here.    
And the recent new approval of a new trait, which is the amylase trait, it is irrelevant to me whether it's GMO or non-GMO.  It's a trait that can determine the process characteristics of corns in the vicinity.  And an admixture level of one part in 10,000 is a game changer as far as I can tell for agriculture.   
I would like to be able to find a way, as I am sure the rest of you would, where farmer X's decisions about what he chooses to produce do not change farmer Y, his neighbor's decisions about what markets to participate in.    
So the process industry that my company serves is keenly interested in optimizing the purity of the products that they get from the farmers of America.  I look forward to our discussions.    
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  We have several   
ex officio members, please?  
MS. BOMER:  Is this on?  
MR. REDDING:  Yes.  
MS. BOMER:  I'm Sharon Bomer.  I'm the assistant United States Trade Representative at the Office of the USTR, Executive Office of the President.  
(Discussion off the record.)   
MS. BOMER:  Sharon Bomer, assistant USTR.  I have 17 years of government experience at USTR and the Agricultural Marketing Service, as well as several years experience in the private sector representing the produce and biotech industries in Washington, D.C.   
As a USTR I am responsible for the Unites States' government's international trade policy development, international trade negotiations for food and agriculture, as well as ensuring that the United States maintains and abides by its obligations in trade agreements.   
MR. BOBO:  My name is Jack Bobo.  I am the Chief of the Biotechnology and Textile Trade division at the Department of State.  And before that I served as the Senior Advisor for Biotechnology at the Department of State.  I've been in the government for about 10 years working on agricultural biotechnology issues, and I spend most of my time traveling to other countries to explain U.S. biotech policy issues and to discuss those policy issues in other countries.  
MR. FREDERICK:  My name is Bob Frederick.  I work with the Environmental Protection Agency and have so for 27 years now.  My experience with biotechnology has extended through those 27 years, including three years overseas with the Stockholm Environment Institute working on environmental risk assessment of biotechnology products and something we do at the agency quite consistently.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Any other ex officio members, members of the committee?  Okay.  Again, I want to say welcome to all.  I think the Secretary used, you know, the description of this looks like America.  It sure does.  When you look at the experiences, life experiences, you know, the wealth of knowledge that's here, I mean, I think this is a great point to start the conversation.   
Why don't we take a quick break, and when we reconvene, we're going to pick up on, in this time slot that talks about sort of these brief remarks from the committee, I'd like to get a little feedback from you on the Secretary's sort of charge.  All right.  Just a very brief conversation just so we all sort of understand what did he say.  Right.  Just so we're clear about where we're going.   
Having two teenage sons, I know that repetition is an important element of learning.  Sometimes you've got to restate several times sort of what it is that we are doing.  Right?  But I want to make sure that we've got that.  I think we even have some written notes that put in a form here what \--   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  That's the repetition.  
MR. REDDING:  Well, it's part of the repetition, the written copy of the Secretary's number one, two, and three points.  So when we come back, we'll take a quick look at that, and then I want to pick up with a review of the history of the AC21 and we'll let Michael do that.  So a quick break.  Okay.  Thank you.    
(Whereupon, at 10:25 a.m., a brief recess was taken.)   
MR. REDDING:  That was nice.  It's nice to hear the exchange and to get reacquainted with folks, and to meet the new members of the advisory committee.  So it was great to hear the conversation.  
Let's reconvene and just briefly, I know we've got some things to get through here before lunchtime, but I want to take say 15 minutes just to get some initial response, reaction, to the Secretary's charge, two point charge or three point charge, whatever you want to put in there.    
But you all have a copy of what the Secretary had laid out in terms of his top two priorities.  As I read this it's focus on one and two and if we have time we get to three.  Right.  So let's focus on the first.    
Just any \-- we'll open it up.  And I would ask again for the benefit of those in the public area that you just restate your name and speak directly into the microphone.  I think we've made some adjustments in the audio in that room over the break, so hopefully that helps.  But again, please just give me the signal if for some reason you can't.    
But we'll open it up and just have a brief conversation here looking at these two points specifically, reaction to that.  That will help inform our discussion a little bit later in the day when we get to some of these discussion areas for the afternoon and of course for the public in the afternoon.   
But we'll just stop there, open it up and any reaction you have to what the Secretary's charge is as he has put before us?  Any thoughts?  Angela.    
MS. OLSEN:  I like Chuck Benbrook's idea a lot of breaking the analysis down into different components.  And I was wondering if you could just, you know, since we are all sort of focusing on the Secretary and taking notes, if you could just review that again, because I liked that idea, again, of breaking the analysis down into the different components as well, because they are very different.   
MR. REDDING:  Yes, please.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Yes.  Chuck Benbrook.  Well, you know, having thought about this a lot back in the Roundup Ready Alfalfa Working Group, there's a different cluster of issues, different types of losses, different magnitudes of losses, and from a realistic and practical point of view, different mechanisms, you know, will be needed if they are going to be dealt with.  
But it seems to me that the three big areas of concern about adverse economic impacts of gene flow and adventitious process that we know about, you know, starting at the big picture, we know about StarLink and Liberty Link and the impact on large sectors of agriculture when an unapproved event or something happens that has a major market disruption.   
 The Department of Agriculture has been responsible for a significant chunk of the tab in the case of StarLink.  I don't know how it's all played out in the case of Liberty Link.  But that's one area of economic impacts that we \-- somebody has got to deal with, because it does happen occasionally, and it has impacts all down through the chain.   
But the second area is the impacts on farmers that are growing a commodity crop.  These are not seed producers.  They are not companies that are making a branded food product, but they are raising crops to sell into the various value chains.  And for those farmers, they are typically looking at economic risks equal to the difference between their income from selling into a premium market versus the conventional or commodity market.    
That's, so simplistically, that's a first cut at what the magnitude of losses are in the event of that kind of an impact.    
And then the third area is on seed producers.  And this could include farmers.  Isaura spoke, as we were talking last night, I mean, there's a lot of small farmers that keep and are steadily improving their own seeds.  So I think there is a, certainly a set of economic impacts on seed producers and seed savers that are very central.   
And Mr. Chairman, just to make the point that I was going to make, you know, I think that we \-- there is an important linkage between the economic impacts on seed producers and the risk exposure and economics to the production sector.  Because of the fear that as more and more genetically engineered varieties are approved, there's this phenomenon of creeping contamination will be unstoppable.    
And that, of course, will happen at the seed industry level, where David Johnson, despite his best efforts, will not be able to continue to sell pure alfalfa lines that don't have GE content in them.   
And if that happens within the seed industry, then the frequency of problems in production agriculture, and the difficulty of dealing with them will go up.  So there is, I think, a really profound linkage between how successful the seed industry and the biotech industry can preserve clean breeding lines, and seed for the non-GE identity preserved markets, and the cost and complexity of dealing with the farm level.  And I think it will be difficult for us to separate those because of that core linkage.  
MR. MATLOCK:  Following on the boundaries discussion, are we restricting our discussion to crops, or are we also going to include animals?  
MR. REDDING:  I think restrict it to crops.  Any objection?  Okay.  I'm interpreting from the Secretary's comments, but I would, I think it's just on the crop side.  
Okay.  Other impressions, thoughts?  Yes, Lynn?  
MR. CLARKSON:  This follows up on Marty asking the Secretary how far into the weeds we should go.  So how far along the value chain should we go?  From consumer all the way back to seed producer, because the losses don't stop at the farm gate.    
You've got a number of processors that want specific things.  They bought specific varieties of soybeans, specific characteristics.  And when they lose that supply, it's a contract and supply.  There is no replacement supply in the world.  They step down to a whole different quality level in their market places.  So losses just run all along the chain.  And I don't know how far we are going into the weeds either.   
MR. REDDING:  It's a good question and I'm reading the Secretary's words, losses by farmers.  Okay.  So I think, again, good point.  We'll have to sort of put that on the unresolved list and then figure out, what do you do with the rest of that supply chain.  Right?  But good point.  Other observations?  Yes, please, Mary.   
MS. MARTENS:  I'm willing to go and work, roll my sleeves up and all of that, with the Secretary's three points.  However, I think it's very important to remember to think about there's an architect named Bill McDunna, that some of you probably know his work.  And he says it's far more effective and sustainable to put filters in the mind rather than at the end of the pipes.   
Unfortunately, I see compensation as a filter at the end of a pipe.  You know, it's admitting that damage has happened and somehow somebody has to pay for it.  Who?  You know, that's up in the air.  Wouldn't it be better to put our filters in our minds to prevent the damage from occurring, the effect from occurring.  And I know that's not the scope of what we were asked to do.  I understand that, and I'm sorry.  But wouldn't it be?  
MR. REDDING:  Doug.  
MR. GOEHRING:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think this is going to be challenging enough, so if we make it too complex by looking at too many levels within the value chain, we're going to have some very large difficulties.  Grant you, I'm looking at this from an insurance point of view, and we've been able to identify a way to address this issue at the front end, which is the production side of it.  		And if we can wrap our arms around that as a committee, as a group, at least we've accomplished something of great magnitude, and at that point, maybe there is the ability later on to work down through the system.  The private sector can even pick up from there and take it on the next step, although the approach I'm looking at is probably a little bit from the private sector where you could possibly initiate maybe the introduction of Risk  
Management Agency cooperating or helping in that ability.  
My apologies, too, Mr. Chairman, Doug Goehring.  I should have announced that right off the bat.  
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.    
MS. ANDALUZ:  Isaura Andaluz.  Following up on what Mary-Howell had just said that, for example for us, we have a collection of native seeds, actually seeds from all over the world.  And a lot of these seeds are, they are naturally drought tolerate, low input, and, you know, these are seeds that have lasted, have acclimated themselves for hundreds of years.    
So if my seed becomes contaminated, then what do I do.  I mean, we save our seeds from year after year.  And so when my seed becomes contaminated, that means that, first of all, I can't save the seed because if it gets, you know, cross-pollinated with a patented GE product, legally I can't save it, right?    
But the other thing is that once that seed becomes contaminated, it's gone.  It becomes extinct.  And so it doesn't matter, you know, if you have insurance at the end, because the thing is that that crop is gone forever.    
MR. REDDING:  Doug.  
MR. GOEHRING:  Mr. Chairman, Doug Goehring.  I understand the concerns, and I guess that's part of mitigation.  It's part of what I had talked about and went earlier in the conversation.  I talked about seed itself and seed production.    
I don't believe this is defined to just organic.  I believe if we look at the model that's established already in seed production, it's the ability to use that as a place to jump from, and start to look at buffers, start to look at those thresholds, start to look at the practices, the structure, the system that's already in place.    
In other words, you would never put all of your eggs in one basket by being in just one specific area.  When I grow seed, I'll do it in different fields, different areas across the county that I farm in, to ensure that if I have a problem with one particular field, I don't risk everything in my seed production there.    
So I certainly understand from the compensation end of it.  I was bringing up the point that if we do it at the front end, we're talking about the production itself.  It wouldn't matter if it's seed or crops.  That would be the point at which we would be looking at a compensation product.    
MR. REDDING:  All right.  Thank you.  Michael.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Thank you.  I wanted to make just one or two quick points.  One, of course is, as the Secretary noted, we have restarted another advisory group, the National Genetic Resources Advisory Council, which is going to be focusing on a number of those seed issues.    
So the committee may want to think about specifically what the division of labor is going to be.  We will have the executive secretary for that other committee who will be here for part of tomorrow in this.  As I was going to tell you later, there will be some cross talk between the two committees.  So that may be something that will be of use.  
The other point that I wanted to make about the breakdown of issues is that at least from my understanding of the charge that the Secretary has, the issues that I think the committee is really being charged with are around a lot of the commercial issues.  It's not specifically on the regulatory issues.  There is a regulatory system and there are violations of law that may occur, and processes that deal with those things.    
So in the cases of things like StarLink and the LL Rice and some of those other situations, those are things that are, I think outside of the main focus of what the Secretary was talking about, because those are legal and regulatory issues.  And to the extent that those need to be discussed, I might suggest that those are things you might consider parking for later.    
I think that the other issues really, those are things that are not supposed to happen.  I think we're talking largely about the things that are happening out on the farm because of farmers growing, attempting to grow things and having more complicated issues.  That's just my sense of where the Secretary was coming from.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Chuck.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Yes, Chuck Benbrook here.  What Isaura has brought up prompts me to make a first request to Michael and the Department for at one of our subsequent meetings I would like to see a panel of experts, some from within the department and some from outside the department brief AC21 on this question of, once a GE gene gets into alfalfa, gets into your peppers, gets into your corn, is it true that it is forever there, or are there ways and processes through which the genetic integrity of Isaura's green peppers can be restored in the event of a contamination episode?   
And this is a, this is a fundamental question in terms of any kind of compensation or insurance scheme because this gets to the risk profile, you know, how once you get a little bit of adventitious presence in a crop is it there forever?  Is it there for five years?  Are there steps that can be taken to get it out?   
So this question of once a gene or gene fragment gets into a germ plasm, can it be removed?  Will it become non-detectible over time?  I would like a technical briefing on that, just to understand, so we all have a better base of understanding, because I'm not sure that Isaura's fear that once there is a little bit of contamination in an indigenous crop like these, you know, valuable land races of peppers, that it's literally true that it will always be there.   
And if that is true, I think that is an important fact for us to take into account in setting up a compensation mechanism.  
MR. REDDING:  Great suggestion and a good question.  I don't know, Michael, in terms of that body of experts, who that would be.  And certainly maybe there are some around the table who could help us identify that, but great suggestion.    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  I think for a start we'd certainly have some people around this committee who will be able to offer some expertise on that.  I can also say that we have experience at USDA with watching, say, what happened in the StarLink case, and you know, there was elaborate monitoring process that went on.  And I think we can provide some information on, you know, the process and the results.  		And I know EPA did some analyses about the necessity for testing over time for that material.  And they also took a good look at the data that came in over time.  Admittedly, that is corn and it's not a saved seed.  But I think there is some instructive things that we can tell you about that.    
MR. REDDING:  Wait a minute.  Sorry.  Did I miss somebody.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  I'll come right back.  
MR. JOHNSON:  David Johnson.  I would respond to Chuck by saying that, you know, the germ plasm committees that have been put in place, I currently serve on the alfalfa one.  We've had our meeting in 2011, our first one. And one of the most important discussion topics we had was looking at the germ plasm collection that USDA maintains, and what safeguards could be put in place as we do seed increases from that to maintain genetic purity.  And so we'd just like to point out that those discussions are underway, and at various levels.    
And there probably are ways at least to go back to original seed stocks where seed stocks can be maintained pure.  The question comes into play is when you are in commercial production, how do you keep things pure at a commercial production level.   
MR. REDDING:  Good.  Josette.  
MS. LEWIS:  This is Josette Lewis.  Thank you.  I wanted to pick up on a point of clarification that you provided, Michael, about the Secretary's major concern being around the commercial aspects of the issue of coexistence. 		And having read through a lot of the background material, think it would be helpful to return to some of the specific examples that are out there to better understand how the commercial sector is dealing with this issue to date, because I think that's very important as we address the question of if any and what type.    
And I would like to stress the if any as well, because I think it's important for us to see how the marketplace is addressing this right now.  But then it will also inform if we decide that that is needed.  That would help us inform the different mechanisms that are available in both the commercial sector as well as potentially not the commercial sector.  
So to summarize, saying that again that it would be helpful to remind us of the experiences out there to date to really delve into the question of magnitude and what mechanisms are in place commercially.   
MR. REDDING:  Good point.  Lynn.  Or Leon, sorry.  
MR. CORZINE:  It's okay.  You can call me Lynn.  
MR. REDDING:  Yes.  Sorry.  It's part of the challenge of names, and they turn them up and then I can't see.   
MR. CORZINE:  Leon Corzine.   
MR. REDDING:  Leon, all right.  And then we'll   
do \-- okay.  
MR. CORZINE:  I would just add, to go on, you know, in the area if we're to look at compensation and commercial production in the area of corn specific with the traits we have, maybe it would help us to take a look at, there is a StarLink issue which is different than any other issue that we have had before, and probably will never have again, but the whole thing about split release and split approvals, and those kinds of things, that USDA has been a big part of helping fix.   
And I believe, Cindy, you were a big part of that as well, working through that.  And we both have a few scars there.  But looking at that, and maybe even a better one would be the BT-10 issue, and see how it worked.  Maybe a good thing would be for us, we all have thoughts, or there are a lot of innuendos about what really happened.  But if we could see, you know, because there were compensations made by the particular companies that made the mistakes.  And maybe that would be a good review, because, you know, Secretary Wilsack talked about the budgetary issues that we have, because we can talk about compensation.  Where in the heck is that going to come from.  Right?  
So maybe there are some private industry schemes, but maybe rather than completely reinvent the wheel, maybe we ought to, it would do this committee a lot of good to have the background on what really happened, and USDA was involved in that, so I would think they would have that in regards to, I think, it would be more relevant, the BT-10 type issue than the StarLink.  But maybe both, because we have the data.  We have the background, and a good number of us have been through that.  
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  We'll take one more comment.   
MR. MATLOCK:  Marty.  Sir, I'll be brief.  Following Lynn's discussion and Angela's question, this issue of legal frameworks first charge is compensation mechanism that presumes harm.  I'm an engineer so forgive me for trying to define these things.   
But I really don't, I've been in this space for about five years, and for me it's very complex, the policy case law regarding harm, IP protection.  The misinformation from producers is pretty significant.  There's a strong misunderstanding about who can do what to whom because of what in this area.  I think that a clear statement of current policy from this group would be valuable.  It would be valuable to me.  
MR. REDDING:  Laura, why don't you comment.  I'm sorry, you had your card up and I missed that, so, okay, and then Mary, we'll come back to you this afternoon.  Okay.  Laura.   
MS. BATCHA:  Thank you.  Laura Batcha.  I have two comments.  One, a couple of clarifying questions, and then one, I've taken some notes going back to Angela's first question about what are the work chunks in terms of hearing what people have said.  So I'll share that with the group.   
We have in the parking lot this issue of loss to non-producers.  And it is clear in part one about loss to farmers.  But I think it may be instructive, given some of the questions that Lynn raised, that we could at least go back with that, with a clarifying question, is that literal to the Secretary.    
I know you all are presuming that's the intent, but it would be nice to have confirmation as to whether or not that's a truly limiting scope on that part, because I do think one of the areas we heard about is, there is a seed element, the farm element and the food element at play here.   
And then I think in general in terms of the three areas that the Secretary laid out, and the order of the events, I think my real hesitance to what Mary outlined about not including preventative strategies as part of the discussion around compensation and risk management is, my fear is that that institutionalizes the burden for prevention on the person who will inevitably suffer the market loss.    
And I think that that could really be a mistake in our thinking, because if there is a preventative strategy that's broader than that, if it becomes part of eligibility requirements, perhaps, something like that, it does institutionalize the responsibility for prevention on the person who may, in the future, experience a market loss, whether that be an organic farmer or a biotech farmer or an IP farmer, whoever that farmer is.   
So back to my second point which is hearing what people identified as some potential work areas.  I think the scope question about the farmer and how it's outstanding, but we had issues raised about starting to discuss, about a financial model.  And I just use that very broadly about what kind of mechanisms could be at play.  
Definition of market loss, magnitude and types of cost that come into play, how do you define those things?  Eligibility and triggers, the Secretary identified that in his notes here.  And then also I'm hearing people talk about relevant case studies, either from within USDA or outside of USDA that might inform the discussion.  So those are the major chunks I heard talked about.    
MS. MARTENS:  If we're doing relevant case studies, I really would like to hear what could have been done differently to prevent this, to have that be part of that.  Because that's got to be a part of the thought processes, not what we do after it happens, but what could have been done before.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Thank you.  Again, there will be \-- this is great discussion.  I mean, this is really what we envision sort of this afternoon being, when we get to the time for the talk about, you know, based on these two charges, two point charge from the Secretary, you know, just making sure we have a good foundation of what that charge looks like.   
We know that there will be some secondary impacts, you know, some questions that are driven off of those two that we don't want to lose sight of.  We we'll continue to keep track of those.    
And then I think we get, you know, later today, just a general conversation about those things that would be helpful to inform the debate, and the discussion here.  Right.  Just whether it's the case studies, whether it's some of the history, some of the experts.  I think that's an important part of the conversation, as we get into, you know, dissecting the question and certainly trying to prepare some type of response for the Secretary.  So keep thinking.  
With that, let's pick up with the agenda.  And I think, Michael, you're going to share us the history and some of the Bylaws, operating procedures, and that will take us to noon.  Okay.  Thank you.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Okay.  Thanks.  I think the discussions have been off to a very good start here.  Let me talk for a minutes about documents and agenda.  As indicated before, you should all have received the revised agenda and also committee members and members of the public should have copies of the Committee Charter, as well as the provisional final Bylaws and Operating Procedures, as well as packets of biographical information for each of the members, and information about relevant USDA agencies that are involved in biotech.  
Committee members will also have received an organizational chart for USDA.  We're not going to be discussing all of that information today, but again, it's provided as background for everyone, and is on the table outside.   
In addition, there are a series of background papers that are outside on biotechnology generally and coexistence, which are provided for everyone here.  Mostly they are from various groups that use biotech, use organic, or are wrestling with the same sorts of topics.  
I'm not going to be listing them one by one.  There are a range of views.  You will undoubtedly, over the course of the next meetings, see more documents with perhaps an even broader range of views.  The department in putting all of these out is not necessarily endorsing anything that doesn't have our name on it.   
For committee members, let me note that you've received a few documents that actually haven't been put out there.  Some of those are pretty long.  They were given to you as background.  It was my judgment we weren't going to get into the weeds of what's in those documents at this point.  When it looks like we're going to be talking about what's in those documents, they'll be provided for the public.  
However, one of the papers that's out there is an earlier paper on coexistence that was prepared by a previous iteration of this committee.  The paper is entitled, What Issues Should USDA Consider Regarding Coexistence Among Diverse Agricultural Systems in a Dynamic Evolving and Complex Marketplace.  We can, if you'd like later on, discuss the contents of that paper, perhaps with some of the committee veterans.  But I'd like to note two things about the paper.   
First, in general, it was an analytical paper, rather than one that gave USDA much in the way of concrete recommendations.  As you heard this morning, the Secretary is asking this committee to go further.  
Second, even though the recommendations in the paper are a little bit sparse, it does contain useful information.  And in particular, I think one useful starting point for this committee's discussion.  And that starting point is a working definition for coexistence.    
Everyone should have a copy, but I'll just read out what the definition was in the paper.  Coexistence refers to the concurrent cultivation of conventional organic and genetically engineered crops consistent with underlying consumer preferences and choices.  
My recommendation for the committee is that for your deliberations you adopt this definition at least provisionally to get started so that you don't get bogged down early on definitional issues.  You can revisit it later as you need, but I would just suggest that to get the discussions actually going.  
Now, from USDA's perspective, there are three main objectives for this meeting.  First, to develop a clear understanding of the committee's scope, purpose, history, and operational process, and that you're going to need that in order to be able to provide useful recommendations to the Secretary.   
As I mentioned, the Charter and the Bylaws you've all received.  And the Bylaws are ground rules that we'll discuss in just a little bit, and that I hope will, on which there will be agreement for as a means to go forward on the committee's work.  
Second, the main aim is to discuss how to organize your overall work, and to consider individual issues, and to describe the potential types of outcomes that you may have.  USDA is asking you to come together using your knowledge and experience as leaders in your areas to help advance this goal of strengthening coexistence among the different production sectors and the different interests represented in this room.  
We've just heard specifically how the Secretary wants you to focus your work.  And you should all have received a written charge that I passed out to all the people at the table. If I've neglected to give those to the ex officio members, which I think I did, I'll remedy that at the break.  And people in the other room should have copies of the charge.  They were put out there as well.   
Third, to determine the most effective way of moving forward subsequent to this first meeting, including, importantly, scheduling the next meeting.  Everyone please bring your calendars to tomorrow's meeting so that we can talk about dates.  I know that will not finalize them, but at least it's a start.    
And from our standpoint, we'll need to know how you think your work would best be structured; what additional information you'll need from us \-- we've heard some of that already today; and how we can help you in your deliberations.  And obviously, we'll come back to that in the meeting.  
On the agenda, going through the schedule, we've played a little loose with the schedule thus far.  We will undoubtedly do the same.  I'm going to be talking some more about the history and workings of the committee.  And later in the day, importantly, we will hear from the public.    
Tomorrow there will be a few speakers.  First, I'm going to give an informational presentation.  Some of the current activities within and without USDA that are focused in one way or another towards facilitating coexistence.  Then the Deputy Secretary, Kathleen Merrigan, will come in with some additional thoughts on how to frame your work in terms of the different sectors and how to move forward.   
And then third, there will be another presentation from Catherine Greene and Jorge Fernandez from USDA's Economic Research Service on the current distribution of costs, risks and returns in different agricultural production systems.   
And then we're going to move on to more substantive discussions, again, how to structure your work; then a substantive discussion, perhaps, on your experiences on how markets, consumer information, risk management tools, and marketing thresholds might all interact.    
And then back to planning, further discussion on the charge and how to address it; how to organize next steps; what information we can provide you; what kinds of outside speakers might be informative, et cetera.  This will be a busy couple of days.   
Rather than stop, let me just go onto the next subject about the history of the committee and operating procedures.   
The AC21 was originally established in 2003 by then Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman.  It's the third in line of USDA's biotech related advisory committees, one in the eighties and nineties focused on research priorities in biotech, the second from the late nineties into the beginning of the “oughts,” discussed a range of policy issues. Then came the AC21.  
And this committee, though, is a committee that's not specifically chartered by an act of Congress.  And what that means is that its Charter has to be renewed every two years.  The Charter for the committee explains the basic purpose of the committee, it's overall structure, terms and duties of members, and the officers of the committee, the kinds of records kept, nature of the advice to be given, estimated costs, number of meetings, and reporting and committee support.  
I should note at this point, though you've already heard this, that we have both regular members and ex officio members on this committee.  Ex officio members provide advice and expertise representing the issues that their departments address.  But they do not participate in the   
AC21 decision making.  
All members should have these documents, and they are available outside.  I'll talk about the Bylaws and Operating Procedures in a minute.  Let me just say that in general the rules that govern the running of all federal advisory committees are set out in detail in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.    
The work of this committee and all advisory committees is strictly advisory, meaning that what you can offer USDA are, at best, recommendations not mandates on the department unless Congress tells us otherwise.    
Advisory committees, by law, need to represent diverse viewpoints.  The previous committee, the previous incarnation of the AC21 met 21 times in the years between 2003 and 2008, and produced four consensus reports which are analytical and informative, and they addressed topics from the impacts of mandatory traceability and labeling requirements in other countries, on the U.S. food and feed supply chain, to issues that USDA should consider regarding coexistence, which I alluded to earlier, to opportunities and challenges relating to biotechnology over the coming decade from the time of that report.   
A fifth report on transgenic animals was never completed before the previous committee stopped meeting, which coincided with the change of administration.   
As I indicated before, the AC21 operates under a set of Bylaws and Operating Procedures.  Though having such Bylaws is not a formal requirement of FACA, we have felt in the past, and continue to feel, that an articulation of how the committee works towards finalizing its work, and how members interact with each other, has been useful to making the process run.    
Because the previous committee operated strictly by consensus, and the range of members views was so broad as it is here, it was never possible in the past to reach agreement on detailed recommendations to USDA.  In fact, I think the veterans on the committee can confirm that it was often a long and painful process to articulate even common understandings of existing facts and circumstances.   
It's for this reason that USDA has modified the old Bylaws and Operating Procedures so as to encourage the development and description of recommendations from this committee.  The new Bylaws and Operating Procedures, which are marked provisional final, you should all have and should have looked at beforehand.    
They address a range of topics ranging from meeting procedures to record keeping to agendas.  Let me mention just a few features of those Bylaws, some of which are unchanged, and some of which are new.  
The AC21 will still seek to operate via consensus, but it will now operate within the framework of a fixed time period for deliberation on topics identified specifically for you by the Secretary.  
Secondly, rather than have the committee itself do the drafting of recommendations, that task will now fall to the chair and to me, and we will seek consensus recommendations.  If there are non-consensus recommendations at the end of the time allotted for a particular discussion, we will attempt to capture the sense of the committee and the various views on each recommendation.    
We would envision that there might be one AC21 meeting at the end of the discussions on a particular topic at which refinements on our draft summary of committee recommendations might be discussed and finalized.  And there will be a mechanism if you all don't think that we've captured it properly for you to provide additional input apart from the report itself.   
Finally, the Bylaws allow for working groups.  Working groups are subsidiary to this main AC21 committee and they report to it.  Working groups make no decisions themselves.    
Consequently, working groups, in contrast to the full committee, do not need to meet in public session.  Their work products get discussed in public by the full committee, and must be approved or modified by this committee before they have any standing.   
So we anticipate that working groups would most often or almost always meet via conference calls.  Working group meeting summaries will be prepared and will be distributed to members and provided also to the public at regular committee meetings.  
The chair, in consultation with USDA, will appoint members of working groups.  Working groups may be comprised of committee members, as well as other outside experts.  So it won't necessarily be exclusively members of this committee.  But like the full committee, they must contain a balanced representation of views as well.   
So we hope that committee members will have taken the time to review the Bylaws and Operating Procedures a little bit more thoroughly than I have had time to talk about here.  But we'd like to get your input on them.  So let me turn the discussion back to the chair.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you, Michael.  Comments.  Reaction, specific to Bylaws?  
MS. HUGHES:  Melissa Hughes.  Sorry, Michael, will the USDA provide any staff support for the working groups?  
That would be it.  Okay.   
 		MR. REDDING:  Is that a yes?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  That is me.  
MS. HUGHES:  Just as far as minute taking or sharing with the group, that will be your responsibility?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Yes, it will.    
MS. HUGHES:  Okay.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Yes, it will.   
MR. REDDING:  Laura.  
MS. BATCHA:  Laura Batcha.  My question is around the Chair and the Secretary's role in drafting the recommendations.  And the Secretary spoke to us this morning.  I believe it was from the Secretary about wanting to understand areas where there was agreement and then areas where there wasn't an agreement.  And that will be \-- I'm just confirming my assumption that that would be the general approach with drafting of the recommendations from the Chair and the Secretary?  
MR. REDDING:  Yes.  I think the intention is to capture those things where there's agreement and certainly have a good inventory with some definition around those areas that, where there is not agreement, and make sure that we have provided to the Secretary an accurate reflection of the conversation.  Right.  Noted.    
So it may be in the form of those things that are unresolved, and we would certainly encourage the Secretary to look at further in some other form, or a continuation of future work.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Just one additional comment on that.  It's our aim, it will be our attempt to have a report that no one will feel requires a subsequent minority opinion on.  So we'll try to capture as accurately as we can.  I know from past experience that even when we think we've done that, it's a hard thing to do.  But that will be our aim.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Any other reactions to sort of how we're functioning as a committee.  Chuck?  
MR. BENBROOK:  I just have a \-- I'm not a veteran of past committees.  I'd like to ask Mary-Howell and Greg and some of the others that, Lynn, you've been on this before, right?  
MR. CLARKSON:  No.   
MR. BENBROOK:  No.  How much interaction among the committee members independent of flowing through you, Michael, or Russell, you as the Chair, is it expected, encouraged, or discouraged?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Well, certainly there will be quite a bit via the working groups.  And all of those conversations are things that get recorded, are required to be recorded under FACA.    
To the extent that you all find it useful to discuss things among yourselves, and work towards other things, anything that advances the committee process, and work towards consensus, I think is useful.  I think anytime that there would be sorts of things that work against that process, obviously it's not as helpful.    
Those things, if committee members want to be in contact with one another, one thing that I think we will do, we didn't have it for this meeting, but we will certainly by the next is have further information on means of contacting, you all contacting one another.  So I think that that, the answer is, it's perfectly fine.    
MR. BENBROOK:  Just Chuck Benbrook, a followup comment.  I like to communicate a lot by email.  I do it a lot.  I would hope that as much as possible the conversations that go on around the table include everyone around the table.  And if that's just active use of the delete button, that's fine.    
But I would urge all of us to resist the temptation to balkanize quickly into subgroups.  And I, for one, when I have something to say, typically, I will send it to everyone.  And if you don't want to get these comments from me, hit delete, hit delete.  And if becomes tiresome, then send me a private email and say, take me off the list because I don't have time to deal with it.  
But I'd rather be exposed to, you know, all or as many of the conversations as possible that's going on because I think if we don't have that ongoing dialogue between our meetings, I just, I don't think we'll progress as fast as we need to, to be in a position to give the Secretary the kind of thoughtful recommendations that he's asking for.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Yes.  Just one other point to add in reference to that.  We've talked about working groups, and those will be set up.  There will be members that are assigned to working groups.  Hopefully we'll get information what topics, how to break up into working groups, what topics, what people's interests are.    
Information about each of the working groups will be available to the whole committee.  And in addition, anyone is welcome to sit in and listen, any one of the committee members is welcome to sit in and listen to the working groups.  There are people who we are going to depend on to be on them, but there are certainly not going to be, other members of the committee are not going to be excluded from them.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Doug, you look like you have a comment?  
MR. GOEHRING:  I have a question, Mr. Chairman.  By the next meeting, I believe it might be in early December, will we have an opportunity at that time to hear some presenters about different topics, and if so, what is the procedure or process, just for clarification?  Is a request made here now, today, tomorrow, to request a certain type of speaker/presenter on an issue/topic?  
MR. REDDING:  Doug, we're just talking about sort of how to do that, I mean, because as was noted earlier, I think there are some folks even around the table who have some expertise that would be helpful.    
I'm trying to gather up what does the short list of topics look like where it would be helpful for purposes of just informing the discussion, the debate a little bit.  I think the short answer is, if there is something that's been noted here today that you really think would be helpful to have inserted in an agenda, and/or, you know, ends up in some further discussion as a panel or otherwise, let us know that.  Okay.    
And maybe that becomes part of, again, the discussion later today and even tomorrow about where to from here, and what is it that we've heard that would be helpful to you as a member of the committee to really understand better a particular issue, to understand some of the history, to help us answer the questions the Secretary has raised on these two points, number one.  
And two, I think for this list that we're maintaining here, this unresolved issues, they are unresolved but they are important to us, and what do we do to also help inform those issues.  And part of that may be with an existing committee or structure the USDA or industry.  But they also are probably issues we want to track.  And so, you know, it would be helpful to have some further discussion around the table on what those could potentially look like.  
MR. GOEHRING:  Mr. Chairman, if the committee would be so willing, I would make a suggestion.  There is an individual that I know that's an expert on concepts, could certainly make a presentation to the committee at the next meeting in December, probably.    
If the committee be so willing, and if the Chair and Michael would want to visit about that, we can certainly have some materials sent out previous to that meeting, but would actually describe and outline a concept for compensating \--   
MR. REDDING:  Specific to compensation as the concept point?  
MR. GOEHRING:  Yes.    
MR. REDDING:  Okay.   
MR. GOEHRING:  Yes.  
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Good.  It would be helpful.  Okay.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Just the one comment that I think we've heard even very early into this meeting we've heard requests for lots of presentations.  So I think we're going to have to figure out how many we can put in one meeting and still give you time to discuss things, how many might go into the subsequent meeting.  So we'll have to, you know, sort of work out the disposition of all of that.    
MR. REDDING:  Yes.  Clearly, again, those who have been through these discussions previously have sort of a working model, you know, that allowed the committee to function before.  And you can see that part of it here is for what makes sense, given the charge that we've received, and what makes sense in terms of your own professional time and commitments, and how do we best organize that work.    
You know, four meetings sounds like a long time until you sort of look at these questions.  Right?  And clearly there is going to have to be some significant discussions occurring, you know, of work group and beyond, to help us get somewhere into a working draft by the third meeting or so.  So how do we really do that?  
It's at these moments when you appreciate the clarity the Secretary provided this morning in terms of the charge.  Right.  Because you can sort of get lost in some of these conversations that are incredibly helpful and important, but they're not in keeping with delivering an answer to the Secretary.  And all of us understand that importance.  
The other piece, I think for just the times we're living, where we are with the Farm Bill, and sort of what that looks like, you know, on the horizon.  I think part of our discussions here, I'd be surprised if there aren't some, you know, elements of a need for, you know, some of the definitional components here.    
How do you structure even within some of the mission charge of the department, but also those areas where, you know, that is our opportunity as an industry, if you will, to have some marker about what it is that we believe from a federal policy standpoint should be of consideration, and how do we want to provide that to those in Congress who are in that debate as well.  So just a thought.    
I mean, both in terms of keeping us focused on getting the job done, but also, how do we inform the larger   
debate on a couple of these points that may not be in keeping with a specific charge that would be helpful from a policy, public policy discussion, to have occurring by somebody.  All right.    
And that certainly can come back here.  But, and so I don't want to lose sight of that.  So please, an important part of this conversation is making sure we've got a good inventory.  And I would ask, as these points are made, don't assume that Michael and I are sort of capturing every one of those points.    
So if you see something that's not up here that we really need to note so we don't lose track of it, please just tell us to capture that and put it up, and also that we captured in the way that it has, and in the words that you want us to, right, and to make sure we know what that means.  
So any other comments about Bylaws or operating procedures, Michael, from your standpoint?  Sorry.  Yes.   
MR. JAFFE:  Greg Jaffe here.  I've just got a question for Michael about the operating procedures.  For the previous committee, which I've been on for a number of years, we have a professional facilitator who was at the meeting.  I don't see them here today.  And I just wanted to know whether that's something that is no longer part of the committee's operations, or something that just isn't here today, but we may see them in future meetings?  
MR. REDDING:  Michael can respond to that, but later on in the conversation after the Secretary called me to accept the chairmanship, that he informed me that that was one of the changes; that at one point there was a chair plus a professional facilitator.  And for a number of reasons it's only chair and no facilitator.  All right.   
MR. JAFFE:  Good.  
MR. REDDING:  There was a good in there?  
MR. JAFFE:  Good.  Yes.  
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Well, my role as chair here is to keep this conversation open.  I have no experience.  I've used professional facilitators.  I would hope that in the spirit of cooperation and professionalism, we can have a debate and discussion and may not agree, and we leave the table understanding that.    
We do the best job that we can do as professionals to answer the question that's been raised, or questions raised, and understand that this is a conversation that will continue in whatever form.  But we can have that as a committee and a group of professionals.      
I don't know what the role of the facilitator was before, but certainly that's the way I'm approaching this is it's an open conversation.   
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. REDDING:  Please, Laura.  
MR. BATCHA:  Laura Batcha, a specific question on the Bylaws.  It calls for the chairman to have the discretion in advance to exclude public comment.  And we have public comment on the schedule today.  So I just wanted to hear from you, Russell, about your thinking about exercising that discretion?  Is it a function of your sense allowed in the meeting and the work load or what is your perspective on the inclusion or exclusion of public comment going forward?  
MR. REDDING:  You know, from my perspective, public comment is good.  I mean, I don't know how you arrive at an informed and defensible answer on these points within a lot of good conversation around the table from the committee, but also those who hold, who aren't at the table who have some really critical opinions that we should hear.  
We'll certainly, from our standpoint, Michael and I have made sure that we've built in time to reflect on the importance of public comment.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Michael, again a Bylaws question.  In the Bylaws there is some discussion of the role of caucuses.  And I would like you to describe the distinctions between a caucus and a working group a bit?    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Working groups are things that we will set up in this, you know, officially set up and we will take minutes of, et cetera.  I think the idea of caucuses is just something that goes to your question earlier about talking among member.  If members want to speak together and have discussions that are independent of the specific confines of the committee itself, members are free to talk to each other in groups.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  The question has been raised about, I mean, are you comfortable with what's been presented in terms of the Bylaws and sort of that governing structure that's laid out there, just so we can sort of check that off and say, that's sort of how we're operating?  You're okay with that?   A nod or just raise your hand quick?  Okay.  So there's a general sense that's fine, that works.  Okay.  Good.  
Now, backing that up, I'm not sure when we wanted to tackle this definition of coexistence that was mentioned earlier, and whether that's an expectation that we'll do that later or do we want to have that discussion in five minutes?  All right.    
Well, let's just open it up.  Let's start there.  That was a point raised, and it's on the to do list.  Are you okay with that?  Okay.    
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. REDDING:  Provisional approval on that.  So, Marty, do you want to?  
MR. MATLOCK:  Just a clarification.  The term genetically engineered is often not used anymore, but biotechnologically enhanced, because genetically engineered, as you defined it, is recombinant, using recombinant methods, which is not the full breadth and spectrum of technology being used today.  In fact, it's becoming a minority element.  So I would recommend, perhaps, expanding that term.   
  		MR. SCHECHTMAN:  From my point of view, the issue that the Department is confronting is specifically on genetic engineering.  And that that is the issue that consumers are discussing.  I think we might consider after discussion of these things as they pertain to genetic engineering how much more broadly those things apply.    
But I would hesitate to recommend, this is just my initial reaction, that we try to move into other technologies about which there may be less expertise around the room or less experience in the commercial impacts of those.    
I understand the point, and I see the value of trying to be forward thinking about a lot of those things, but I think the specific \-- to the extent that coexistence is going to go beyond genetic engineering, I think the principals that we will be talking about, about how different production sectors, using all sorts of different technologies get along, may indeed be more general.    
But I think the Secretary's charge was pretty clear about the particular sectors that he wanted the committee to focus on.  But I certainly welcome the discussion of how broadly the wonderful consensus that you will reach in a few meetings, will, in fact, apply.    
MR. BENBROOK:  Mr. Chairman, Chuck Benbrook.  On this definition that you read, Michael, I have no problem with it being adopted as the point of departure, but it's not, in my judgment, a finished piece of work.  And I think it will be something we will want to return to probably at every meeting.   
And I would just recommend that for, there is going to be a few key concepts that we will talk about and work on as a group throughout this process.  I think standards and thresholds are another example where the precise wording will be quite important.    
And I think it might serve us well, maybe by the second or third meeting, that we have a formal process for individual committee members to recommend a change in any of these provisional definitions where we note the reason why we feel the existing definition is inadequate, suggest the alternative language, and any arguments for that.  
I think this is going to make your job a lot easier, if you put the burden on those of us that think something is not expressed appropriately, to get us to really layout why.  And I think that this will help you in giving the full flavor to the Secretary at the end of the process of those aspects that we're not all on the same page on.    
So I'm fine with as a starting point, but I think we will probably want to return to it almost at every meeting.   
MR. REDDING:  That's an excellent point.  I think having at least a starting point there, I admit, right.  I mean, obviously there's been a lot of work previously by the committees to get to that definition, not understanding all that was around it, but at least give it as a reference point, but have it be a standing item that needs some discussion.   
I'd like the perspective of answering why.  Right, I mean, just, I think it's a reminder while each of us carry to the table perspectives on this and discussions and experiences, helping each other sort of understand the lie, right, why is it that way?  What's happened?  Why are we viewing it a certain way is part of the work of the committee as well.    
It will certainly help us inform the writing.  And we can articulate sort of what the views of the committee were much better by having some insight to the thinking.  So with that, Leon?  
MR. CORZINE:  Leon Corzine.  On the definition of coexistence and a following question as far as how we may differentiate.  Before, we talked about conventional, organic, and genetically engineered.  In the area of crops, in particular, corn, soy, wheat and probably cotton, it really is the biotech, or genetic engineered is the conventional.    
I mean, you can look at the figures.  95-96 percent of the soybeans, getting near that on corn.  So  would it be more relevant to combine those, in particular, or recognizing it may be different for Isaura and the crops that she grows.  And so is it useful to differentiate a little bit between what are large scale or row crop production corn, soy, wheat, cotton, and some of the other crops?  Because the issues are quite a lot different.   
What it takes to coexist is also different, although there are some similarities.  And I think some of the issues that we've had around coexistence in the past and continue to have, especially when you look about deregulation, slowing down some technologies, for example, let's say corn.  They are slowed down because of issues around another crop.   
So can we classify those, or is it useful, is the question, to do that, to help us as we look to the future and have, and end up with recommendations that really are useful and practical when we get out into the countryside and into growing our products?  
MR. REDDING:  Reaction to that?  Thoughts?  Isaura.  
MS. ANDALUZ:  Okay.  I want to make sure that I understand what you are saying.  You want to take \--   
(Discussion off the record.)   
MS. ANDALUZ:  So you're saying, instead of having conventional, organic, genetically engineered, that we take, that genetic engineering and conventional be combined together when we're looking at this here.  Is that what you're saying?  
MR. CORZINE:  In a word, yes.  And here again, recognize that it may be different for some of the other crops or products that are grown.  But certainly we should recognize it in the crops of corn, soy.  And the practicality of it is, is conventional is, biotech is part of that.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  If I can just respond, I think the intent, conventional there was intended as a shorthand for identity preserved non-GE crops.  We can certainly, you know, clarify what we mean by conventional there, but it was meant to talk about crops that are not biotech, but that are not organic as well.    
And certainly though it's not set within the definition, I think coexistence between biotech and biotech, between non-GE and non-GE of different types, between all of the various, perhaps even between different organic.  I don't know if that's something that will at some point become some issue.  But the idea is that it's all of the different kinds of interactions there.   
So I think you raise a good point that it was a little bit of a shorthand there, but the intent was to talk about various different identity preserved forms of agriculture, and biotech, whether that's large B biotech in corn, or small b in a crop where there's just a very little of it.   
MR. REDDING:  Alan.   
MR. KEMPER:  Mr. Chairman, Alan Kemper, and Michael, you said my words so eloquently I do not have to repeat them, but that was exactly my meaning, because I would like to suggest that Mr. Clarkson and I and others will want to have discussion on identity preserved in the various traits and conventionalities and other systems.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Thank you.  Laura.  
MS. BATCHA:  Laura Batcha.  Thanks for raising the issue, Leon, because I think how we define those terms is going to be important, and what we include.   
But I would agree, I think it's important that we bring identity preserved as language into the definition eventually.  I think that there are some that view as I believe Lynn does, that organic is a subset of identity preserved, from his business perspective and model.  So I think the boundaries aren't going to be that clear cut.    
But I'm hesitant to make conventional and genetically engineered synonymous with each other, because there are many commodity crops for which there are not currently deregulated biotech options for farmers.  And I think that would be confusing to combine the terms.    
MR. REDDING:  Leon.  
MR. CORZINE:  Okay.  To respond to that, and I understand that, and that's why I kind of wanted to raise this to have this discussion because in my part of the world, when you look at conventional \-- I think we need a new definition there, if that's what we mean.  Because this definition of coexistence, and Greg probably remembers it better than I, but we were talking about processes.  Okay.  And identity preserved is a process.  
So how is identity preserved different than organic?  I mean, do you want to take a look at what is \-- because when a lot of folks across the world look at conventional, they think about what I do in the midwest.  Okay.  And what I do in the midwest includes biotech products.  
And so when you read this, there's a lot of confusion that, well, wait a minute, biotech is not conventional.  Well, yes it is.  So maybe those are the kinds of definitions if you, Russell and Michael, as we talk about defining terms and taking a look at this, defining coexistence, maybe we need to redefine those, and it should be more \-- and I don't know how you hit and get across, like the crops Isaura raises versus what I raise.    
But somehow we need to redefine those terms, I think, to make it relevant and to clear up a lot of the things that get misunderstood when people around the world read what we come up with.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Chuck Benbrook.  I really agree with where you are coming from, Leon.  I think when we get down to talking about mechanisms and how to establish losses, it will inevitably have to be done one crop at a time.    
And when we talk about corn, conventional corn is GE corn.  And so we can, at the crop level, we can get away from a lot of the problems that we'll have.  If we try to craft language that encompasses all of agriculture, we're going to keep stumbling over situations that don't fit at all.    
So I would encourage us to accept that when we do get down to the specifics, we're going to be talking about a major crop, corn, and certainly corn, soybeans, alfalfa, cotton are going to be, and sugar beets will be high on the agenda.  And I think we can customize the wording in the context of specific crops.    
MR. REDDING:  Good discussion.  Yes.    
MR. KISLING:  Keith Kisling.  Where are you going to put wheat?  We have no genetically altered wheat?  We're not conventional and we're not GM and we're not organic.  Well, there are organics, but we're not GM or conventional then, if you combine them.   
MR. CORZINE:  If I may respond.  May I?  Well, you're going to have pretty quickly, probably.  But I think when you look at that and whatever, however we define, and that redefinition of conventional, it doesn't mean the conventional is biotech specific.  It is what we grow for commodity production.  So to me, that would answer that question.  Maybe not well enough, Keith.  
MR. REDDING:  Yes, I'm just trying to diagram this conversation a little bit.  I appreciate it, because I think it really gets at this issue of what's in the definition and the subsets of that definition.    
And I keep thinking about the definition is critical in terms of responding to the Secretary's question.  And in some respect he would only get an answer to the question by crop, right, and not by practice but by crop.  So it's a great conversation.  We just need to keep thinking about how we mold that, I guess, is the right word.  
But I don't want to be presumptive in terms of taking what today is a generally understood component of coexistence and excluding somebody, or quickly putting them into a category where they are not presently.   
And, but we are in the business of trying to solve a problem, and not create one.  Right?  As a committee, I can also see that we could quickly end up in a conversation about, why did you put me in that category or presume that that's where we're headed.  Right?  That may not be.   
But it also is a reminder that this is a working definition and one that will evolve both in terms of our own informing it, but also what we carry to the table to help in this conversation.  So it's an open question.    
I'm sorry.  Josette, did you have \--  
MS. LEWIS:  I just wanted to sort of head in the same direction that I would caution us about getting hung up on having a major task being defined in terms.  Really, again, from what the Secretary has said, what the background literature that has been provided us from all sides has said, is that this is about a market based issue, and a question of commercial definition.    
So I think if we want to understand the range of identity preserved and specialize segmented markets, it's best to look at how the market is currently handling those issues, as opposed to us coming up with the definition which frankly might not match that, and potentially lead down some blind paths.   
MR. REDDING:  Doug.  
MR. GOEHRING:  Mr. Chairman, Doug Goehring. I believe part of the confusion may lie within what appears to be the norm, is conventional.  And I think that's where the confusing part comes in.    
I, as a biotech producer, also have conventional practices and conventional crops.  So I understand what you raise about it seems to be the norm because 97 percent or 96 percent of all the soybeans in the United States are biotech soybeans.   
But it is the other side of that which is that 4 percent are also grown conventionally for IP, plus we have those that are grown in the organic market.    
So I believe that it probably hits what we really are as an industry in the United States when we talk about organic producers, conventional producers, and biotech producers.  Just my belief, my opinion.   
MR. REDDING:  Good.  Thank you.  Lynn and then Mary and then Missy.  
MR. CLARKSON:  Lynn Clarkson.  Leon, I appreciate your point.  I've been involved in these discussions almost daily with industry folks for about 16 years.  We have, at times, tried to refine the terms by switching from conventional to traditional, because conventional will change with time.    
But conventional has been so well accepted and so well understood or fixed in the minds of the people that we regard as our market, that we quit trying to refine the terms, and just accepted conventional.  I'd be happy to accept conventional here, because I think everybody understands what we mean.   
MS. MARTENS:  Words can be dangerous.  We in the organic community have a name for all of you folks.  We call  you chemical farmers.  Does that make you feel good?  
I think that we need to be very careful about this.  And rather than putting words on like conventional or unconventional, maybe we need just two circles.  GM crops, non-GM crops.  And then within the non-GM crops are all the different subsets.  But the whole theory of coexistence will be so that one circle does not impinge on the ability of the other circle to carry out a productive, successful farm, you know, and just get value judgments and words out of it.  
MR. REDDING:  Missy.   
MS. HUGHES:  Mary-Howell's caution to be very careful with what we're working with is what I'm concerned with right now.  Looking at this definition, I'd have to say that about a half hour ago, when we were discussing Bylaws, I thought, okay, when are we going to get to the meat of it, and now I'm good with going back and talking about Bylaws if we want to.   
I'm going to throw something in here just to shift gears a little bit and stir things up.  With this definition of coexistence, reading through it, I like Mary-Howell's suggestion of just having non-GE and GE for the purposes of working through this problem with the word conventional.  
But I would want to throw in this suggestion.  It says, consistent with underlying consumer preferences and choices.  And thinking about what the Secretary asked us to focus on, which is the producers, and compensation for the producers, I would wonder if we wouldn't want to add in consistent with underlying consumer preferences and farmer choices to recognize the fact that there are farmers who are consistently now, I think, even perhaps since this was written, talking about the idea that the farmer should be able to choose what they want to produce.   
So I would suggest that we add in the word farmer to clarify that it's also farmer choices and consumer choices that are important here.    
MR. REDDING:  Alan.  
MR. KEMPER:  I'm going to drift just a little,   
Mr. Chairman, on the fact, because I'm still basically gnawing on the definition, but also on the charge of the Secretary.  
On point one he talks about the presence of GE materials.  And actually it is actually non-GE or GE materials, depending on what you are raising can contaminate.  I can take a traditional or non-GE corn and get an affect on another field by drift or whatever.  That will affect me and my neighbor.    
So my question for staff is, can we say that the presence of a non-intended crop or whatever should be, you know, should be at fault or whatever, instead of labeling, all the sudden GE is a victim here of that.  I think we need to say non-GE or GE into that.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  
MR. REDDING:  That's interesting.    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  If I can respond to that.  I am very reluctant to open up the charge, given that I think that sets a precedent, though I certainly, I hear your point.  I will bring that issue back and discuss it.  But I think it's a fair point.   
I think it's a fair point for the future.  I think in terms of what the current debate has been about, it has really been more focused on the presence of GE stuff.  But I take your point very well.  I will bring that back to inquire.   
Let me just make one other point about the question of definitions in terms of what is conventional and what's not.  I think we will have to wrestle with exactly how things are defined when whatever the recommendation comes out and looks like.    
I think for the purposes of initial discussions as long as we are clear to each other which segment of things that we're talking about, and the people in the next room can also understand which segment we're talking about, and that there are not \-- that the words that we use don't lead to any confusion about the scope of what we're talking about.  I think the discussions can proceed.    
We understand that figuring out exactly what the final terms are, whether it's called conventional, whether it's called identity preserved, whether it's grouped in a different way as Mary-Howell suggested.  I think as long as we are around the table clear to one another, we can, we can finalize exactly how we want to express which segment it is as we get a little further down the process.  
MR. REDDING:  There's sort of \-- I'm sorry.  Yes.  
MS. WILSON:  I guess one other quick issue I think we haven't addressed is that of point in time, because definitions will change with time, as you all have stated here so eloquently.  I think once we establish at what point in time these will apply, those other issues become moot at that point.    
MR. REDDING:  There's sort of, there's two issues here.  One is the practice.  The other is the people, to Missy's point.  All right.  I mean, who is impacted by it.  Because you've got a definition that's got a consumer label on it.  And really what the secretary has asked us is to look at the farmer.  And I think that's an important part of the conversation.    
The other is sort of the practices, and whether it's on the conventional or GE, et cetera.  For purposes of this conversation, I guess the question becomes, to what extent we want to modify the people side of that to make sure at least from a definitional standpoint we're consistent with what the Secretary's charge to us is.  Right.   
And then put on the unresolved list sort of the practice component that will need to be monitored as we go forward here.  Right?  It can be agreed that it's both an action item and unresolved on, because we need to say, yes, I agree, we're starting at this definition.    
So can I ask for some feedback on the point that Missy has raised, do we want to insert this farmer crops consistent with underlying consumer and farmer preferences and choices, as an amendment to the provisional definition.  Thoughts on that?  Marty.    
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Show of hands.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Call the question.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Call the question.   
MR. REDDING:  So here again the question was specific to the amendment of this definition of coexistence to include, to insert the words, crops consistent with underlying consumer and farmer preferences and choices.  So and farmer is the amendment.  Do we \-- I see some looks.  So just raise your hand to say, yes, I concur with the inclusion of those two words in the definition.  Okay.  So we will amend it for that.    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Let's just see if there are any opposed.   
MR. REDDING:  Yes.  And those opposed?  Opposition to that amendment?  More discussion about it?  Okay.  
MS. MARTENS:  Can I answer why I'm opposed?  
MR. REDDING:  Sure.  
MS. MARTENS:  When we talk about farmer choice like that and add that in there, the question that the other side will always have, will always say is, well, you could make a different choice.  And I think that's opening up a discussion that is not probably a good one to have right now, here.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  One final point.  Jerry.  
MR. SLOCUM:  Mr. Chairman, Jerry Slocum.  I would ask that we put Mr. Kemper's point about the unintended presence of unintended materials in the parking lot.    
MR. REDDING:  Good point.  Sorry.  Barry.   
MR. BUSHUE:  Actually, I just wanted to comment on Mr. Kemper's suggestion as well.  I think it's critical, if we're talking about, and while I understand the charge from the secretary is compensation, I understand there's a recommendation that we specify that to GE.  If we're talking about coexistence, and we ignore the discuss that Mr. Kemper just brought up, I think we're doing ourselves a disservice.   
MR. GOEHRING:  Mr. Chairman \--  
MR. REDDING:  Doug and then Leon.    
MR. GOEHRING:  Doug Goehring.  Not to detract from what we're charged with, I am a little fearful, though, that if we continue to engage in just the definition or having this dialogue, which certainly puts a lot of things on the table, we don't ultimately get around to dealing with this issue.    
And I'm not sure that this issue alone about coexistence, is a definition that we need to talk about the compensation issue.  And I just raise it because I would hate to see us get bogged down on this issue for the next two or three meetings.  
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Leon.   
MR. CORZINE:  Well, bringing the point \-- Leon \-- a little responsibility for creating this issue a little bit.  But I thought this discussion needed to be had a little to just see, to sort it out.  And I'm fine.  I was really interested in what the consumers and users if they are accepting of what is conventional.  Because as you mentioned, Latresia, it sometimes changes with time.  So I, it's no burning issue of mine, and I think it's fine and maybe we should move on as Doug mentioned.   
But I would also caution that, you know, we talked about caucuses a while ago, and Mary, do not throw out disparaging words.  Keep that within your caucuses, I would suggest, because that doesn't, that's not helpful to our work.    
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Let's wrap this up.  I think we had sort of an amended definition on coexistence that was presented to include the words, and farmer.  I understand that that's not a consensus, but at least there is some acknowledgment as to why.  
And the words that are used presently in that definition we'll accept as our provisional definition to start, right?  And we'll continue in the discussions going forward, and agree that that becomes sort of a standing item.  We can come back to the definition.  Right?  There is nothing to say we can't.  And we just keep that as a point of conversation going forward.  Is that acceptable?  Okay.  
With that, why don't we break for lunch.  Do you want to give instruction, Michael?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  There is a cafeteria, a small cafeteria one floor below us here.  There is a larger cafeteria, to which you would need to be escorted and escorted back, in the main building.  I am happy to escort people across the way and bring folks back if they would like that.     
MR. REDDING:  Are there places across the mall?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  You are certainly free to go out.  This area is a little bit of a wasteland for finding restaurants right here.  Actually, if you go past the main building and down 12th Street, there is a sandwich shop or two that's down there as well.  There's also a fancy restaurant that I will tell that you won't get back in time for.  It's the option that gets you back here the quickest is one of the cafeterias in the building.   
The small one will be slow in getting us all through.  As I said, do people want to go next door?  Okay.  So I'll take people across.    
One more thing, and this one is off the transcript.  We're done with the official discussion.   
(Discussion off the record.)   
(Whereupon, at 12:20 p.m., a luncheon recess was taken.) 

	A F T E R N O O N   S E S S I O N  
MR. REDDING:  Let's reconvene.  We really appreciate the conversation this morning, and the active exchange of ideas and thoughts.  I think that was a great start to our work.  We'll certainly continue that this afternoon.    
To our public friends, welcome.  We will have some time beginning around 3:15 today for public comment.  And I will have some introductory comments that will frame sort of how that will proceed at that time.   
Just a reminder on cell phones and such, if you don't mind hitting that off button here again.  We had them on over lunch, as I did.  So just a reminder.    
We'll pick up with the ethics presentation.  Stuart Bender is here, is the director of the Office of Ethics within the USDA just to sort of review with us the rules and what rules we've got to live by as committee members.  So Stuart, welcome.  It's nice to see you.  Thank you.   
MR. BENDER:  Thank you so much for having me here.  I want to start off by telling you that the most important information I'm going to tell you is that my phone number is 202-720-2251.   
Now, if you didn't write that down, don't worry because it's on the slides that will be on the screens.  And also, I've brought ample copies of handouts.  And also, my presentation will be placed by Dr. Schechtman on the FACA website.    
For members of the public who are really interested in ethics, you can read everything I'm going to be telling you today on the website, as well as in the materials here.  So you'll each get a hard copy.  
I like to have ethics training be three things.  Brief, concise, and even shorter.  So I've gotten a half an hour of your time, and my goal is to go through my slides in about 15 minutes, and leave the rest of the time for questions from you all.    
So now you all are sitting around.  This is a very esteemed and very respected group.  Oh, by the way, there is my contact information in case you weren't a speed writer.  You also have my email address.  You can email me as well.  I'm very much  in the high tech age.  I even know how to use  a remote clicker, which is a good skill to have.  
I also want to, at the outset, acknowledge members of my staff.  The Office of Ethics is the centralized ethics office in all of USDA.  Throughout all of USDA there is only one office that deals with ethics.  That is our mandate.  That's our mission and we do in every day.  And I have members of my staff in the overflow room, around the room, who are here to listen to me and if you ask a really, really tough question, hopefully they will come to my rescue.  That was a joke guys.    
So what am I doing here?  Why do you need to hear from an ethics attorney when you are volunteering your time to work in the public interest?  And the reason is because of the fact that if the public does not have confidence in the integrity of the work you do, nothing you do matters.  		If the public has any doubt about your integrity, you can write the best report ever and it will not get accepted.  Ethics is that important.  It goes to your credibility.  It goes to your integrity as an organization, as an advisory group.  It goes to the heart of everything.    
So the work we do is very important and we do it every day.  
So I just want to run through, what is an advisory committee?   Well, you all know what that is because you are on one, and you've been vetted for one.  So you know it's a committee board, panel, or other similar group that's been established by a statute or by the agency head or by the president for the purpose of obtaining advice or giving recommendations on issues or policies within the scope of the agency's responsibilities.  
Well, clearly the work you're doing deals with agriculture, and you are at USDA, so you are in the right place.  So now we know what an advisory committee is.  Oh, and stop me at any time, raise your hand and ask questions. 	Anybody here around the room happen to be a professor?  Okay, great.  I love questions.  Ask as many as you want.  Good.    
Since this is a briefing on advisory committee, just a quick thing on what advisory committees do.  They have a Charter that establishes them with a mission and their duties.  They are fair and balanced with the committee membership.    
You all represent a very diverse and very specialized interest.  And you are sitting around the table because you bring something unique to the viewpoint.  You're either really, really smart, or you're really, really smart and you represent the interests of segments of society or the business sector, or the farming community, or you're even smarter than that.   
You have a designated federal officer.  In this case it's Michael Schechtman, who is your executive secretary.  A DFO or designated federal officer is a really key player for a number of reasons.  He's the guy who does the name tags.  He's also the guy, if you think you have an ethics issue, you want to go and talk to him and say, I'm not sure this is a problem but what do you think.    
And he may say, you need to talk to Stuart.  Or no, it's not a problem.  Or let me look into it.  But if you have any questions, go to your DFO because he's your easiest reach.  You can always call the Office of Ethics, but now you have two avenues. You have your DFO and you have your ethics officer.  
Advisory committees have open meetings that are noted in the Federal Register.  Members of the public can be here.  Your Charter expires after two years, unless provided otherwise in your Bylaws.   
Now, committee members, let's talk about you guys.  This is all about you.  And really, the thing that I want to tell you is, in ethics, I can sum my job up into one phrase.  And that is the ability to spot a problem when it's big enough to see but small enough to solve, because you don't want to spot it when it's too big to solve and you didn't see it.  That's when everybody heads to the doors.    
But basically what we do is, we're issue spotters.  So we solve a problem when it's big enough to see but small enough still to solve.  And that requires us to look at who you are.   
So if you're sitting on an advisory committee, you constitute one of three distinct groups.  Regular government employees, and I'll refer to them as RGE's; SGE's or Special Government Employees; or Representatives.  And those are terms of art in the advisory committee world.  
If you're a regular government employee, you know that because you're a full-time or permanent or part-time employee of Uncle Sam.  You're paid a federal salary.  You get your paycheck from Uncle Sam.  A show of hands, anybody here a regular government employee?  Okay.  Good.  
You're subject to all the federal employee ethics laws and rules.  That's not a surprise, or it shouldn't be a surprise to regular government employees.  And they may submit an ethics financial disclosure report, depending upon their position.  They have a position of trust, then they would file a confidential or public financial disclosure report.   
If you're a Special Government Employee, what I would call and SGE, then you perform temporary duties as a federal employee.  And here's, that's the distinction.  What it is, is while you are a federal employee, while you are serving on the panel, you're a federal employee.  So you're an intermittent employee.   
I've often talked to groups and they say, well, what's an image that you can come up with to convey what an intermittent employee is.  And the best thing I can come up with is, intermittent wipers on your car.  They're on when they're on, and they're off when they're off.  So you're temporary in that you have lives outside of the government.  You're not a full-time government employee.  You are intermittent in that you serve a certain number of days out of the year.  It's a limited part of your work day, of your work life.    
You can be on a full-time or part-time basis and be a Special Government Employee.  You can be with or without compensation.  I think for all of you around the table who are SGE's, you are not compensated, correct?  Sorry about that.    
Your service cannot exceed 130 days for all federal service during a 365 day period, and part of a day counts as a day.  So if you work for four hours, that counts as a day.  And you're usually there because you are a subject matter expert, what scientists call a SME.  Anybody ever heard that expression before, subject matter expert?  
What are subject matter experts?  People who make I statements.  I believe, in my opinion, as an expert I have concluded.  People who make those statements are usually subject matter experts and are Special Government Employees on advisory panels.  They're subject to all the federal ethics rules and laws with some limited exceptions.    
But they're basically subject to the federal employee's rules.  So they have the best of both worlds, they don't get paid but they're subject to the ethics rules.  Isn't it great.  Who volunteers for that one?  Okay.  
Now, let's talk about a Representative.  They're not a federal employee.  If you are a Representative, you are not a federal employee.  You only represent a specific interest or group such as industry, a specific industry, consumers, labor unions.  And Representatives make we statements such as, we farmers believe, we soil scientists believe.    
They represent a particular viewpoint.  And the reason they are considered to be Representatives is that you are representing a specific sector or a specific part of the economy that needs to have a voice.    
And Representatives play a very important role, because you can be a Representative and be a subject matter expert, but you're there in a dual role.  You're there because of your expertise, but also you're speaking on behalf of a sector or part of the economy that needs to have a voice, again, that fair and balance, that committees are fair and balanced.    
So you represent a particular viewpoint.  And it's known if you're a Representative that you may have a bias.  You may have a bias in favor of the interest you're representing.  Everyone knows that around the table, and that's taken into account.  That's why you're not considered a federal employee.  
So, now, I just said the ethics rules don't apply.  However, there are certain rules that do apply.  You cannot participate in discussions that involve specific matters involving specific parties.    
So you can't participate in discussions of awarding monetary grants or specific contracts that would involve your employer, your family member, or business partner.    
Now, I understand the work of this group is broad policy, correct?   So if it ever comes up that you're considering grants or contracts, which I understand probably would be very unlikely, that would come up.  So broad policy, you're fine.    
But if it's a matter where this was a panel \-- and just to give an example, HHS has many, many panels that give out grant money.  They actually give out federal money to scientists who do research and development contracts on pharmaceuticals and a variety of issues.  You wouldn't want a Representative to say yes, my wife definitely earned that grant.  She should definitely have it.  Even if they are a Representative, there's just something about fundamental fairness and integrity that would be challenged if they were allowed to participate in that.    
So even if you're a Representative, it doesn't mean you're quite out of the ethics rules.  You can't participate in matters that would have a direct appreciable effect if those are contracts, grants, audits, investigations, litigations, or applications.  Again, your committee probably doesn't deal with that.  You're dealing with broad policy, so you're probably safe.  And if you have any questions, you know who to call.    
Now, let's talk about political activities.  This is a political year.  We have a presidential election.  The entire House of Representatives is up for Congress, is up for re-election.  One-third of the Senate is up for   
re-election.  There are various gubernatorial and state campaigns all around the country.  
Here's some advise on political activities.  And this is for all committee members.  You cannot solicit political contributions in a federal building or while discharging your official committee duties.  You cannot wear political campaign buttons while on the panel and in a federal building.    
So you cannot wear any campaign buttons, unless it was, you know, if you wanted to say like, you know, Wendell Wilkey, that would probably be okay.  Abraham Lincoln, that would be okay.  But other than that, don't do it.   
And be careful of political campaign emails.  And this is the one to be trickiest, is that you may see a really, really funny political cartoon, and you may want to send it to the members of the committee because they could use a laugh.  And you just want to be careful.  Being really funny is not a defense.  So if you receive it, that's fine.  But be careful about forwarding campaign emails.    
If you are ever in that situation, what I would beg you to do is, pause, reflect, and talk to Dr. Schechtman or myself or my office and ask the question of, gee, can I do this, and we'll probably tell you not to.  But you can always ask us.    
And I want to go back to the question about soliciting.  You cannot use your position on this panel to solicit funds for a political campaign.  You just want to be very careful on that, not that you would anyway, but at least that's why you have an outlet.  If somebody asks you to do that, you can say, no, no, sorry.  It's against the rules.  Any questions on that.  Yes, please?  
MR. MATLOCK:  Not related to political campaigns, but related to just proclamations of our participation, I presume it's okay to put this on our CV our vitae \--  
MR. BENDER:  Absolutely.  That's fine.  
MR. MATLOCK:  \-- our web pages, that sort of thing.  So that's not an issue.  
MR. BENDER:  That's fine.  You can, certainly you can put your service on this panel on your resume, on your CV.  Absolutely, that's fine.   
Now, how many of you are Representatives?  How many of you are SGE's?  How many of you are not sure?  Okay.  Basically, for those of you who are Representatives, I've just gone through the rules you need to know.  The rest of this presentation deals with Special Government Employees.  So you should still listen up, because you may, at some point in your life become a Special Government Employee.  So you should know what the rules are.  But here I will go a little bit faster.   
Special Government Employees have to submit a financial disclosure report to the Office of Ethics.  We review that for conflicts of interest.  And, you should always promptly notify your DFO about any ethics issues.  And that actually applies, that's a good rule of thumb for everybody on the panel.  And you must receive annual ethics training.  This counts towards that, so that's good.  
You are prohibited from accepting anything in return for being influenced in performing your official duties.  In parlance, that's called a bribe.  Now, this includes gifts that are offered, or job offers, or gifts offered to your spouse or dependent children.		  
So if somebody wants to give your kids Rolex watches, free college tuition, or trips to Europe, come talk to me.    
You are also covered by, if you are a Special Government Employee, by the conflict of interest rules.  And these are very complicated.  Basically, what I've given you up there is the rule.    
You are prohibited from participating personally and substantially in any particular matter that would affect your financial interest or those interests of certain other people that are imputed to you.  And imputed is just a fancy ethics word for attributed to you, such as outside employers, your spouse, or business partners, or a potential employer with whom you are negotiating for employment.   
So for example, let's say you are a Special Government Employee.  You're serving on this panel.  And during your service you get called up by a company that wants to offer you a $50 million a year job.  Take it.    
You would need to know while you are negotiating for that, that there are conflict of interest rules, if that company is a prohibited source, and you'd want to talk to   
Dr. Schechtman or myself to make sure you don't inadvertently trigger or trip wire over those rules.  If anybody gets a $50 million dollar job, my name is Stuart Bender.    
Another thing about the ethics rules is that they apply even after you leave government.  Now, wait a minute.  You guys are here.  You're serving.  You're not getting paid.  You're doing public service.  And I told you, while you serve there are ethics rules.  There are conflict of interest rules.  And by the way, these are all criminal code rules.  These carry very severe sanctions of jail time and prosecution.    
And now I'm going to tell you that for some of, for some instances, these rules apply even after you leave federal service, again, if you are an SGE.   
Now, in your case, this is going to be very easy, because the post-employment restrictions are a restriction on representation back to the government.  So when you end your service here, when you go back to your private sector lives and you're no longer a member of the panel, you cannot represent back to the government on the same particular matter involving specific parties. 		  
Now what's that?  That's a term of art that ethics people love to throw out.  And it basically means, contracts, grants, audits, investigations, applications, litigation.  Those things with identifiable parties.  You're dealing with broad policy, right?  You're fine.    
So, but if you do get involved in particular matters involving specific parties, contracts, grants, audits, investigations, applications, litigations, then you want to talk to me.  But if you're not going to get involved in that, don't worry about it.    
Some other rules to know if you are a Special Government Employee, you can't take a gift from a prohibited source for your service.  So if somebody wants to give you that Rolex, that car, that trip to Europe because you are serving on this panel, you can't accept it.    
You cannot participate in particular matters involving a covered relationship.  That's another term of art that we have in the ethics world.  And that basically means family and friends, business partners, people who are your second cousin once removed, people who are your neighbors, friends of the family, people who may be living in your house but are not related to you.  You just want to be careful that you don't work on any particular matters that would impact them.  
And again, here what we are talking about is those contracts, grants, audits, investigations, those specific matters involved.  So you can't give them grant money or contract awards.    
No unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic information.  That would apply for all of you.  Basically, you know, when the committee breaks up into subgroups and has its discussions, you have to go through appropriate channels through your DFO and through your chairman before releasing that information.   
Here's one that gets any professor or anybody who is associated with a university.  If you are a Special Government Employee, you cannot receive an honorary degree without prior ethics approval.  This also applies if you are nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  I've not had the honor of doing that legal memo yet, but I would be delighted to.  I'd love to make it.  If any of you guys want to be the first, that would be great.  I've always wanted to have the career goal to write that memo.    
But basically, the reason is, if you are accepting an honorary degree because it has stature to it, you want to make sure that's being given without a conflict of interest.   
No fund raising from persons whose interest can be substantially affected your official duties.  So if somebody advises you, asked you to do fund raising, come talk to us first.   
No unauthorized use of your title or position for private personal use, or the endorsement of a third party.  You can, however, put it on your biographical information, your resume, or CV.  
No compensation for outside teaching, speaking, or writing related to your official duties.  But, there is absolutely no restriction on teaching regarding a regular university course.  So professors always are happy about that second part.   
You cannot be an expert witness except on behalf of the United States before a federal court or an agency of the U.S. as a party or has an interest in that litigation.  And if you are ever called to be an expert witness, you just want to check with your DFO or myself.  
There are restrictions on political activities that we talked about at the beginning of the half hour, that the Hatch Act, which is the act that applies on political activities, applies on those days that you are officially serving.    
So if you are a Special Government Employee and you're working four hours, you are under those restrictions for those days you work.  Any questions?  Now, I don't get paid unless you ask questions, so please, no question is too mundane.  Yes, please.   
MR. ANDERSON:  Paul Anderson.  Are you going to address confidentiality issues around the deliberations of this committee?  
MR. BENDER:  I certainly can.  I certainly can.  It's actually more of an issue for your DFO.  And in confidentiality, the overlap between confidentiality and the ethics world is that you can't disclose information of the inner workings of the panel without going through the process.   
Now, because you are on an advisory panel, it's a very transparent process.  You have a website where you will be posting your minutes, your meeting minutes.  But when your working group meets and hashes things out, there are guidelines and rules that you have.  And I'll actually defer to your DFO on specifics on that.  But that's a good question so I get paid today.  Anybody else have any questions?  
As I said, I will leave copies of my handouts for you all to have.  It will be on your website.  And as I said, the most important thing is the phone number.  If you have a question, call.  There's no question too mundane, and there's no question that is sort of too silly.  
The one thing I will tell you is that in many ways, USDA will give you a lot of resources.  You have an excellent resource in Michael Schechtman.  You have a wonderful resource in your chair.  But another resource is the Office of Ethics.  We are attorneys and ethics specialists who will give you accurate advice that will keep you out of trouble.  And we're the only lawyers in Washington who will not charge you a penny.  So thank you for your time.  
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  I appreciate the instruction.  There are copies, we'll send it around.  Stuart, thank you for the instruction.    
You know, it's one of those presentations, we've been through this, but I also know from time to time, having been in public service, it's the little things where, you know, you forget.   Somebody gives you something.  You forward an email out.  You have a conversation.  So it's good to have that reminder that it's important to us to keep that in mind.    
It is about credibility.  Your opening statement, Stuart, is an important one.  Also, being funny is not a defense.  So we'll remember that as we get into this conversation.  Marty.  
MR. MATLOCK:  Mr. Chairman, Marty Matlock.  I have a question for Michael, and perhaps you as well.  When we're contacted by members of the press and asked questions, how, what's the appropriate way for us to respond, because presumably we are contacted as Representatives of this body.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  I think I'll try to address that question, Paul's question as well, and just but before I do that, just sort of make the emphasis that this is a committee that's likely to be a pretty high profile committee.  And that means that everything that this group does is likely to be scrutinized.    
And that's part of the reason why I wanted to make sure that there was this presentation today, because this is a topic that a lot of folks are interested in, and they will, people may want to look very carefully at exactly how this process is working.   
So with that statement, let me first go to Paul's comment.  Under FACA, FACA is part of the government in the sunshine procedure.  So basically that means that unless there are very specific reasons why a committee meeting has to be closed, all of the records, which is not to say the transcripts of every conversation, but certainly the transcripts of these public meetings, and summaries of all of the other meetings that I call for whether it's for a work group or for the whole committee, summaries of those things are part of the public record.  All drafts of documents that are officially exchanged from USDA to members are part of the public record.    
In terms of confidentiality, records of discussions among yourselves, obviously, not included within that transcripts of discussions of work groups are not included in that.  But summaries of the meeting, of meetings of work groups will, in fact, be included.  And there are only very limited circumstances when, in fact, for a meeting of the whole committee, we could close part of it.    
And that refers to things like talking about confidential business information; matters of national security if we were entrusted with doing that; personal information about individuals.  Those sorts of things are some of the reasons why it could be closed.  But otherwise, the committee meets in the sunshine.  And it's all part of making sure that the department is not getting, you know, whispers in its ears from the side, but is opening, but is working in an open and transparent process.   
And then to your question, which I have now blanked on \--   
MR. MATLOCK:  On the press.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you, the press.  Members of the press, you're obviously free to speak to whomever you wish.  We ask that if there is a discussion that is going on, that you not characterize the views of others on the committee.  And that if we reach a consensus view, it is your duty as a member of the committee to speak that view to the press as a Representative of the committee, regardless of whether you are a Representative or an SGE on the committee itself.  
And of course, we want to encourage all of the most civil and professional ways that all of us will interact with each other and the press.  
MS. BATCHA:  Laura Batcha.  Can you make any remarks distinguishing the transparency in the public record versus what's subject to FOIA communications between committee members that are not copied with a federal employee are not subject to FOIA?  Is that correct?   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  I'm not an attorney.  I think, my first guess would be, if you have a conversation with someone else on the committee and you write notes on that, if that's not part of one of our meetings, that's not FOIA-able.    
Anything, anything that is an official record of this committee is not only supposed to be FOIA-able, it's supposed to be accessible to the public in an easier way.  So it's beyond having to go through the legal or the procedural dance of submitting a FOIA request, et cetera.   
MS. OLSEN:  Michael, would you like to maybe share with this group how that situation might be different if, for example, somebody copies you on an email, which is, again, part of the working group, but yet they may copy you on an email, and how that might change the analysis under FOIA?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Any communication that I have with a member of this committee via email is going to be included in the committee record.    
MR. BENBROOK:  Michael, one quick question.  I just wanted to confirm what I thought I heard, that the full transcript of the official meeting is, will be posted about a month after the meeting, the full transcript?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Yes.  I wouldn't hold us to the date, but it will be posted.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Well, you know, I would suppose that comments to the media could be a problem for me.  I do a lot of interviewing on biotech.  I have for many years.  Our, Barry knows, our local Capital Press Paper is very interested in this issue.  They ran a long story on the   
AC21 committee.  They actually had a very positive editorial about AC21 being a place for an adult conversation about these issues.  
And I just want everyone to know that my personal bias is to talk to the media.  And I think what the media have to say is an important part of the, said in the environment in which these issues are playing out.  And frankly, I think a lot of the more extreme voices have dominated the media, and that hasn't helped.  
But I also understand that it can be, you can get out onto shallow ice pretty quickly.  But you know, if I ever think I might need a life preserver, I'll call you up and you can throw me a rope, maybe.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Perhaps you might consider keeping one on hand.  I will say that, you know, you are obviously free to talk about the topic of coexistence, but I think you ought to be at least a little careful about talking about the workings of the committee.   
MR. MATLOCK:  Full disclosure, as university president, this is Marty Matlock, I have, all of my emails are FOIA-able.  If you send me an email, anyone can see it.  All they have to do is ask.  I don't know who else on this committee has that same burden, but I think it's important to know.   
MR. REDDING:  I'm sorry.  I jumped ahead.  Any \-- you're reaching for the card.  Keith.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Microphone.  
MR. KISLING:  It didn't go on?  I already have a television station going to interview me at 2:00 on Friday.  And so I think what I'm going to try to do is give a generic answer and let them know what the committee is about and not give them any specifics, because until we really come up with something, I don't think personal information is anything I want to give them right now.  I'm just going to try to give them an overview of what the committee's about.  And that's really what they want to know.   
MR. REDDING:  Barry.  
MR. BUSHUE:  The specific charge from the Secretary, I'm assuming that that's not something that we have to keep amongst ourselves.  I mean, my members are going to want to know what the hell I'm doing here.  So \--   
MR. REDDING:  Yes, I think I'll say, that is now part of the record, and certainly we can talk about the Secretary's charge to us.  Yes.  Any final questions on ethics, ethics related, press related?  Okay.  Good.  Thank you.   
The agenda at this point sort of gets us to this conversation.  It's much like what we had this morning before we broke for lunch.  But I'd like to focus in on looking at the secretary's charge to us, this two point charge.  And looking at those points specifically, understanding that, you know, the conversation we had just before we broke, you know, is related to this.   
But I think sort of taking the questions at face value today, and then really beginning to look at these two points that the Secretary has laid out, one of course being the, what types of compensation mechanisms, if any, would be appropriate, number one.  And two, sort of the implementation components to that.  
I realize in some ways that sort of prejudges part of the conversation, but I think it really, we just need to get it out there and begin to be thinking about, what does that mean, you know, based on the conversation we've had.  We know what's expected of us.  What would these things begin to look like?  Right.  
And my hope is that we can, with this conversation, again we only have an hour to do this, or less, and we'll carry this into tomorrow's conversation.  But the hope would be that this conversation begins to provide a little bit of a blueprint for what we need to do, and hopefully inform, you know, what the work group would look like, what's the action plan, right, to begin to respond to the Secretary's charge.  
So with that, I mean, why don't we just open it up.  And I don't know, you know, if we just start with the first question about the compensation mechanisms.  And it sounds like some of you had some experiences with this, or at least have given some thought to.  So for just purposes of getting the conversation started, Doug, why don't you please just sort of give some perspective.  We'll get this conversation forward.  
And then immediately following this, of course, we'll have the public comment period as well.  So with that, Doug.   
MR. GOEHRING:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, I'll throw it on the table so it can be consumed, digested, and \--   
MR. REDDING:  If I can ask everyone just to introduce themselves \--   
MR. GOEHRING:  I'm sorry.   
MR. REDDING:  \-- yes.    
MR. GOEHRING:  Exactly.  Doug Goehring.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Something I alluded to this morning was a concept which was derived after a conversation that took place last fall concerning compensation for contamination to crops, and more specifically at that time, it was focused on organic production.   
I have the opportunity to tap resources outside of my expertise, because I am not an expertise in this area, although I've been involved in insurance to some degree.  But I worked with an insurance product developer who came up with a handful of concepts, one being a risk retention group.    
He alluded to the fact that after looking into this and he said, you know, this is very doable.  If a risk retention group is put in place, because first of all, as he started to research this, he said, there is actually no documented cases of contamination when you look at seed or organic production.   
Now, take off the table the StarLink issue.  We're talking about, and being very specific concerning seed and organic production.  If there is any problems that have existed out there, it's either anecdotal or it's being dealt with at the local or regional level.  So the things that we perceive real or not may or may not have taken place.    
He worked from that vantage point, and looking at it from an insurance company's point of view, how they would put this together.  He thought, for several million dollars, which would actually be pennies on a policy, so to speak, you could provide protection in the event that there would be contamination.   
Now to broaden the scope, took it a step further.  It wasn't just about organics, because part of the basis, and we had this or I made this comment previously, when you look at seed production, there's a perfect model that's already in place because you have to implement best management practices.  You have to have a system and a structure in place that helps you mitigate some of the risks involved.    
And then the other thing is, hopefully, through what takes place in our conversation, and what we take back home, we also create dialogue between farmers at the local level, no matter what their purview is, if they are conventional producers for identity preserved, whether it's for seed production or whether it is for organic production.  Again, we're looking at a market.    
We're looking at economic factors.  And that's primarily how we move forward looking at this risk retention group, that a producer who feels that they need to protect the viability of the product that they're producing, because it goes into a special market so it could be a specialty crop, or produced in a certain manner, it is contracted.  And they would need provisions in place.  And a product like this that could be designed would provide that type of protection economically for them.  
And what was really interesting, and I actually argued with them at first because he put the kiss scenario in place and said, keep it simple, he was absolutely right because he said, you already have programs that are designed out there to certify producers, whether you're in seed production or whether you're working with a contractor or a broker for a specialty crop to sell into another area, or if you are in organic production you have standards and thresholds that have to be met.   
And as long as a producer complied with those standards, if, in the event there was a claim, as long as you complied with that, and the auditor, auditor/adjuster would find that there was compliance, there would be no qualms about paying out on the claim.    
The company would then continue to, or the risk retention group itself could continue to monitor the activity, look at and determine over a period of time how they needed to adjust rates accordingly, based on risk, based on activity out there.  But it would be a product that would be very inclusive because it's looking at all of agriculture.    
And that's what makes it somewhat simple and not necessarily unique, because you have a larger pool to draw from which makes the product and the concept and the product itself more viable and affordable.   
If there is an opportunity \--   
MR. REDDING:  This is a private product?  
MR. GOEHRING:  This would be a product that can be developed.  And in fact, the product developer right now is working on another risk retention group.  I should say, and I have to be careful how I state this, because they were working on something that could ultimately be for livestock production in the United States.  And they were working with USDA at the time to identify if there was an opportunity to move forward to do something like that under a different risk retention group for the livestock industry.   
So there would be an opportunity to develop something like this and move forward now.  The other mechanics or mechanisms that could be put in place that could work with the risk management agency to find out if there would be the ability to work with them to have a product that could even be federally subsidized to some degree or to a small portion, would have to be also talked about if the group advised the Secretary in moving down this path.  That would be a whole other set of discussions and conversations.    
But I throw that out as food for thought.  And this individual, if the committee so chose, and at your discretion, we could certainly invite them to the next meeting, and they could give a presentation overall of the concept that they've designed, and how the mechanics would work.   
And I imagine there would be a lot of questions, because everybody has different scenarios that they want to throw out there and have him address.  But I thought I would put that on the table and we can go from there.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Certainly that's an option.  I guess looking at this conversation of trying to identify these mechanisms, you know, what are they.  And certainly a private insurance product is one of those.  So let's try to identify what these different mechanisms may look like.   
MR. BENBROOK:  I have a comment to make, but I just wanted to ask a quick technical question of Doug.  This concept of a risk retention group, that's a concept that exists within the private insurance industry, and is not a term of art that's in the crop insurance statute?  
MR. GOEHRING:  Correct.  As far as I'm aware, it is not within crop insurance itself.  That's why if you were going to take a product like this, you would have to probably go through the process to identify where you can marry that up with a risk management agency to identify any support for the funding, or to help with the funding.    
But certainly right now, under ARPA, back in 2001 and the 508(h) process, all crop insurance concepts now have to be developed outside of USDA and risk management agencies.  So this is actually a crop insurance developer that has worked on multiple other concepts.  And this is one of them that they came up with when I asked them, what could we do for the compensation of contaminated products, the economic side of it.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Now, Mr. Chairman, my suggestion would be that certainly before we can get too far in the discussion about mechanisms, we have to define more clearly what the economic harm is that needs to be compensated.    
I would suggest that one of the first working  groups that we set up would be charged with, for at least the four or five major crops for which there are GE varieties in commercial production, that a group for each crop define the likely scope of what you might call the market disruption payments, to keep it generic.  You know, exactly what kind of economic harm, and at what level either has been experienced or is anticipated in the future.   
And if we kind of develop by crop a taxonomy of what these harms might be, and do a little bit of work on how one would quantify the harm, and in some cases it will be quite straightforward.  I had a contract to sell the land at $7 bucks a bushel.  I can't meet his specifications.  I only got $4 bucks a bushel, so it's $3 bucks a bushel.  You know, that's kind of straightforward.    
But I would suspect there is going to be some other issues.  And I think of, you know, Michael Funk, and his experience with the non-GMO project, there are food companies and farmers who are selling to food companies that are now voluntarily adopting a set of practices to minimize GMO and avoid GMO content, and, in fact, meeting a standard of .9 percent, which is embedded in there in the non-GMO program rules.  
So here we have a case of proactive steps that are being taken to avoid contamination.  And I think one of the things we'll have to talk about as a group is, are those, in effect, defensive, proactively defensive steps compensable?  
MR. REDDING:  I guess my concern, I don't disagree, you know, getting into this sort of these proactive steps being taken.  And maybe that's part of our conversation here.  A little bit concerned about, you know, getting into a by crop, whether it's possible to do that in three meetings or so.  But just hold that thought.  Laura, you had a point?  
MS. BATCHA:  Well, I definitely have a point, but I'm going to wait and let this conversation about what Doug has put on the table continue.  So I'll just ask my clarifying question to you.  
You made the statement that the risk retention group identified no documented cases of contamination.  Can you further explain where that information would have come from, from the risk retention group?  
MR. GOEHRING:  Doug Goehring.  What he found through doing the research and throughout the insurance industry is that insurance companies have not been paying out.  That doesn't mean that at the local level things probably weren't being dealt with.  And maybe in some cases they might have even went to a district or local court.    
But there was nothing that was significant that when you would take and put actuarials on this, and they would start working on it, they could find a lot of harm, economic harm done throughout the country or the industry that would raise red flags and cause them concern that they would have to have a very high premium for the product.    
In fact, they found the opposite to be true.  They really felt that there is very few cases, given how large the industry is, and how many different crops there are.  In fact, they weren't even concerned about the crop species themselves as much as they would look at the value of the crop, what is a person insuring overall.  				  
Understanding what the contracts are, you would base the premium on the risk and the value of the crop, much like we do now with crop insurance.   
MS. BATCHA:  And I think, you know, I have some questions about the underlying data and assumptions.  So I think where we don't continue with that discussion, with the individuals who develop the concept, I think it would be more appropriate to perhaps save those questions for them.  
My second question is this model to clarify that you've put on the table requires that the individual who is trying to protect against the contamination be the holder of the insurance product.  Is that correct?  
MR. GOEHRING:  Doug Goehring.  Yes, that is correct.  Part of that boils down to having some ownership in the product, in the risk yourself, much like we do with crop insurance.  It is a federal subsidized program that you can benefit from.  But you, through best management practices, actually have to understand that some of that risk is with yourself.    
And although we can't hold mother nature and others responsible for things that take place, such as in some cases we have unknown causes that destroy a crop, as long as that trigger is a claim, your crop insurance adjuster is out there adjusting that crop and then paying you.    
Now, if they can identify what it is, they would certainly mitigate for it or write it into future policies.  But it's a gray area.  And in some cases it all depends on what the problem is.  
Now if there is something that continues to show up, one of those red flags when you are insuring a product, you are going to start to take that into account.  And companies themselves, or the developers, will start to try to address that by, and mitigate for it by either adjusting the premium or going out and trying to address the problem itself that's on the ground, what's ever causing the problem.   
MS. BATCHA:  Thank you for that.  And I will just say, again, I think we can save the details for if the concept is presented.  But I think that I would have some concerns, from our stakeholder's perspective, because currently the status quo, as it is, already assumes all of the responsibility for the risk outside, for the individuals producing the identity preserved product.    
So I think there are some assumptions around this idea that the individuals engaged in the identity preserved production would need to assume some of the risk.  I think currently the status quo is that they assume all the risks.  		So I have some questions around that as a fundamental assumption in the concept.  But we can get to that if we further explore it.  
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.   
MR. GOEHRING:  Could I respond, Mr. Chairman?    
MR. REDDING:  Let me grab Josette, and we'll come back.  Okay.   
MS. LEWIS:  Thank you.  I think before we dive into looking at specific modalities of mitigating risk and compensation mechanisms, from the conversation this morning, and the little bit I think of the underlying question that was slightly debated in this last discussion, I think it would be a very helpful starting point to look at actual incidences of losses, be they at a market level, or perhaps also throwing in that bucket a bit of the technical questions.    
For example, that we came up with this morning, talking about the permanence of gene flow and what that might mean.  So there may be a little bit of leveling of an understanding among the group about what the actual experience has been, and some of the technical.  So from the commercial market side of things, and from a technical stand point.  
And I guess I would offer and maybe ask for a clarification from Michael, if I understood from a comment you made earlier, in particular we're not looking at illegal incidences, so like the StarLinks and the Liberty Links where there was a regulated act that was broached; but rather, market based problems of economic loss associated with unintended presence.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Just to clarify a little, I think there may be things that this committee can learn from those instances, but I think the focus of what the committee should be addressing are problems that are within the real of things that happened legally.    
There are other mechanisms, there are laws, there are civil penalties, et cetera, for things that go out there that are not supposed to be there.  
MR. REDDING:  Mary.  Mary-Howell.   
MS. MARTENS:  I worry \-- this is Mary-Howell Martens.  I worry that your model is not addressing coexistence.  Coexistence to be implies shared responsibility and shared response.  And it sounds kind of like your model for insurance is, well, you can think of all sorts of birth control type analogies with, the bottom line is, two are involved.  Okay.  The end result is the result of two.  
And I think in this case, we have to look at it as such, too.  When we're insuring against weather, weather is an inanimate random uncontrollable kind of force.  But when we're insuring against a technology, that isn't exactly the same.  So I think if we're going to look at your model as far as coexistence, we've got to involve two.   
MR. KEMPER:  Mr. Chair.   
MR. REDDING:  Yes, Alan.  
MR. KEMPER:  Mr. Chair, thank you.  Alan Kemper.  I just want to go back to Josette's comments, because for us, I always hear the claims of damages and not damages.  But I would hope USDA would have some actual tables that can show us that, not only on organic versus maybe GE, but also on conventional versus conventional, i.e., pollen drifts and things like that.  
I'm sure somebody at ARS, because I pay a lot of money to that company, has some data that we can use there for that, or ERS, or one of them.  But between the USD agencies, I'm sure they'll come up with some of the tables that will help us.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  I mean, the question raised about, are there actual \-- Josette's point about, are there actual incidences where we could point to and at least begin to get some boundaries on what this mechanism would look like.  All right.  What's been the problem that we're trying to solve.  Right?  And what's been the experience in terms of that approach, whether that has been by, you know, settled by some means or some lawsuit, otherwise.  
If we looked at it that way, I guess, I'm just struggling a little bit in terms of how to structure this conversation this afternoon, and then say, what is an appropriate response to, whether it be a private or a public response, to compensating for those types of losses.  Right.  
So what has been the occurrence?  Do we know that, and how those determinations have been made in terms of losses?  Would that help to inform how we would, you know, potentially compensate for them?  
MR. KISLING:  Mr. Chair, otherwise all we do is go with hearsay versus hearsay \--  
MR. REDDING:  Yes.  
MR. KISLING:  \-- and inuendos, which nobody wins on.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  
MR. REDDING:  Right.  It's a good point.  So just on that point, and we'll open it up, I see some cards up here, I mean, does that make sense, or am I missing something here that's key in terms of how we approach parts of this conversation on the compensation.  Keith.  
MR. KISLING:  Mr. Chairman, I have some information on the drift, pollenation drift that I've brought with me.  And when we get to that point.  And it would be on wheat.  It's self-pollinating, I know, but it does give you an idea of how far it does drift, and it's a short period of time.  It was scientific evidence that I've brought with me.  So when you're ready for that, I'll give that to the committee.    
MR. REDDING:  Okay.    
MR. BENBROOK:  Mr. Chair, Chuck Benbrook.  I would certainly include or amend my suggestion for a working group looking at the scope of economic impacts by crop to include documentation of actual instances that have happened.    
And for those of you who haven't been following this closely, I think many of us that have been following it, and some of us that have been living with it, like Lynn, it happens a lot, a lot more than what most people realize in terms of hot loads having to be dealt with, having to be diverted, having to be commingled, additional steps being taken.  	  
But at this point it's still a manageable problem, in my judgment.  And the sooner we kind of get at it, the better.     
I do think that it would be quite feasible, you know, within a working group, for us to compile a set of specific examples that have been either brought to the coexistence discussions before.  I mean, for example, Fred Kirshman, the examples, and what Fred Kirshman has experienced on his farm in North Dakota is about as clean and clear of an example as possible.  And it's fully written up, you know.    
So it will not be difficult between even now and the next meeting to have a number of very clear cases of what has happened.  And I think that I agree with Alan.  I think it will really help us to get concrete about what it is we're trying to compensate for, and what kind of a mechanism might take place.   
And it's my opinion, having thought about this a lot, and you know, I am an economist by training, I completely agree with Doug in that the actual amount of money that's likely involved at this point, where the damages pales in comparison to the amount of money that's already been spent fighting over it.  And I think that that will, you know, for the foreseeable future, that will continue to be the case.  
So, you know, I am quite confident that went push comes to shove, it would be possible to develop a compensation mechanism that's not going to break the technology developers.  It's not going to break the government.  It's not going to break anybody.    
But it needs to be, as Doug says, it needs to be   
\-- the transaction costs of implementing it need to be kept very low or it will defeat the purpose.    
MR. REDDING:  Yes, please.  Greg, I think you were up and then we'll \--   
MR. JAFFE:  Okay.  This is Greg Jaffe.   I guess one of the things that I look at when I see question one there in the draft charge is, again, I think we were talking about it earlier, we said this is really related to unintended presence of GE material.    
But there are a lot of other examples out there of unintended presence of other types of things, whether it's pesticide drift, whether it's trying to produce blue corn and you get white corn in, or something like that.    
And it seems to me it would be helpful, from my perspective, to have some understanding of what are the compensation mechanisms that exist for those kinds of things, and whether any of those could be adapted to fit this kind of situation; whether those are commercial compensation systems, whether those are litigation, or whatever those have been.    
To me, that is something here that would be helpful to us is, you know, to the extent that you don't want to reinvent, you know, invent the wheel all over again,  and come up with whole new compensations that if there are ones out there that are working in other situations that could be adapted to unintended presence of GE, that would be, I think, a valuable thing.  
And I'm not sure how to get at that information,  but to me, that's something that is very important to us, taking other areas that have some similarity, where you have economic losses, and then seeing how those are dealt with.  
MR. REDDING:  That's a great point.  Please.   
MR. FUNK:  Michael Funk.   
MR. REDDING:  Michael.   
MR. FUNK:  We're aware of many companies who are seeing increasing contamination, GE material, particular, you know, corn and soy.  This data isn't making its way to any central data bank for us to take advantage of.  Primarily, it's not information they want out.   
So one of the things that this committee could do is to commission some kind of study on contamination where we're able to dig through some of the sources of information out there.  And we maybe have a better hand on answering, you know, some of these questions.    
But I would caution us on the fact that if we are looking at solving this problem, we have to look at it long term and thinking about the number of items, number of GE crops that are in place today, versus what could be in place 10 years from now, the problem is just going to continue to grow astronomically.   
So whether there are many examples of contamination today shouldn't really stop us from trying to solve the problem.  We know how many items are up for approval and what could be the problem down the road.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  If I can, I'd like to respond to two things.  One is about the power of this committee to commission a study.  And I will tell you that that power is very small.  The ability of the Department to commission studies, certainly has that power.  Whether we have the money to do that, and exactly how to go about getting that information?   
I mean, I think, I think there is value both from my perspective, just offering this in having a better understanding of both what the current situation is as Josette indicated, but also recognizing that it's an evolving situation.   
I think we have, from the difficulty that I know people have had in gathering this information systematically, I know that most of the information that's out there is, I guess, anecdotal.    
And the information, and two of probably the best sources of that information are probably on this committee, one of whom runs a company that has to deal with the sources, and the other of whom is involved in the non-GMO project, which gets to see the rates of rejection and those sorts of things.   
And I understand that the confidentiality concerns about saying what any one entity does, but I wonder if there are ways that that sort of information might be bundled and provided to the committee to give us a sort of more, a fuller picture of what the current situation is.   
MR. FUNK:  Well, yes, to respond to that, I would think if we could form some type of subcommittee and put some people on it that have access to certain data, and that maybe we could come back with some conclusions to share that might be helpful.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Just sort of two quick things on that.  One is that I think there will be some discussion of the data that exists already in the presentation from ERS on the agenda tomorrow.  The other things is that I don't think that that subcommittee, the sort of group that you are talking about, is likely to be something that we can form as an official subcommittee of this group, because we need, we need the experts to go off and gather the information, not for a balanced representation of views.  
To the extent that you, the people who experience this, can gather that, some form of that information and present it to the committee next time, I think that would be really useful.   
MR. REDDING:  Lynn.  
MR. CLARKSON:  Lynn Clarkson.  Cathy Greene, who is going to be, I believe, making a presentation tomorrow, and some other folks at ERS, have tried to address exactly what you are talking about.  And there are a number of companies that have a front row seat to this effort who are apparently agreeing to provide her their information going back X number of years.  
The caveat that's being made is, names are being stripped away from any contract.  And there are a number of companies that have dealt in the conventional world with the Japanese demand for non-GMO materials.  So there are millions and millions of bushels that have moved out of the Pacific Northwest and down the Mississippi, that have been tested.  Every load has been tested for years and years.   		So there are a number of companies serving that market that have very important and analogous information that carries over to the discussions of this committee.  So Cathy Greene, who is going to be here tomorrow, is probably the best source of information within the USDA.  And she's making herself available.   
MR. REDDING:  Good.  Thank you.  Laura and then Doug.   
MS. BATCHA:  This is Laura Batcha.  We at the Organic Trade Association began some work to consolidate the available data on this, to Josette's point about documenting incidents as a place to begin.  We consolidated a dataset of about 15,000 test results for corn and soy.  And we did make that work available to ERS, through their work.    
And if appropriate, we could share summaries with the committee to look at the results of those data compilations.  So we have begun that work and there is a starting place to begin from looking at that in terms of actual test results and incidents of GMO presence in IP and organic crops, at the crop level.   
MR. REDDING:  Alan or Doug.  
MR. KEMPER:  I just had a followup from Lynn, because your example, and maybe Catherine will talk about it tomorrow, talks about contamination, about going down the river.  But that sounds more like a grain trade issue than a farmer to farmer contamination.    
MR. CLARKSON:  Lynn Clarkson.  Yes, it is a commercial contamination, but it is generally traced back to farmer to farmer.  And there are all sorts of disputes in the supply system that go to the actual farms.   
MR. REDDING:  Doug.  
MR. GOEHRING:  Mr. Chairman, Doug Goehring.  In response to some of the conversation that has taken place, and maybe a question ultimately I will have in the end, but back to Laura's question and comment about bearing all the risks, you are exactly right.  
We, as agricultural producers, there are some things that we bear all the risk on and have no coverage.  In the concept that we're talking about, even though you bear some of the risk, part of the risk by paying a premium.  And hopefully we could maybe see, or that USDA would see the light of sharing also in some of that, at least there would be compensation.  So the risk wouldn't be totally borne by the producer because there would be some compensation for any losses.  
The other side of that is, when looking at a product, an insurance product, let's say, that you're going to purchase and own, by having some ownership in it, if you completely leave it up to another entity to pay that premium or create a fund to compensate anybody for any losses, it invites fraud and abuse.    
And I think that's the biggest thing that, in the private sector, they certainly try to get away from.  And as the chairman pointed out, is this a public or a private issue?  Maybe it's a public/private issue that can be tackled together, cooperatively.   And that would be one of those things much like crop insurance works, concerning the issue about contamination, and whether it is just organic crops.  
 		I think the reality is, if you are a seed producer and you have had your seed contaminated as a conventional seed producer, contaminated by other seed from pollen drift or whatever, a product that ultimately could have been applied through pesticide drift, you have damage there also.   
If you had the ability to be in this group, you would have the ability to be compensated.    
And then moving forward, I guess my last question would be, are we looking at addressing the issue on compensation?  Or are we looking at trying to hold someone at fault?  And if we want to continue to go down the road of what those mechanics should be, and who we can point the finger at, who should pay, do we ultimately get to the point with what we were charged with was to find a way to compensate producers who suffered a loss?  
So we can keep talking about all the other things, but ultimately, are we going to try and do something to address compensation for those that suffered a loss from contamination of some sort.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Daryl.    
MR. BUSS:  Daryl Buss.  It seems to me that the discussion that we've had about scope is, to a degree, already accepted in the nature of the first question.  So I think it begs the issue of, do we think issues have arisen.   
So I would see that kind of a sense of scope to be primarily important to companies that might be thinking about insurance, getting a better assessment of what could be the scope of payout.  But it could also be useful for number two in terms of what were the testing and triggers, tools that would be needed to implement it.  
But I think in those contexts, I guess I would be \-- I'm not sure how well we're served by being exhaustive in terms of documenting exactly X number of issues, other than in terms of defining the overall scale of the problem.  So if there would be compensatory mechanism, roughly how big is that need.    
MR. REDDING:  Yes, the first, you know, question assumes there is a need to do something.  Right.  I guess that's where the Secretary was coming from.  And I think, you know, the round table discussion here is, if that's the case, how do you approach that.  Right?  And I guess that's what I sort of heard this afternoon in different ways using, you know, is there a model of adopting from other mechanisms, whether they be legal or insurance.  Right.  Or it's for something else we just haven't touched on, you know.  And I guess that's what I'm trying to draw out a little bit.  I'm trying to picture this conversation where I'm being asked to look at a mechanism, but I'm not really sure what the private sector has already done to mitigate that.  Right.   
There's been settlements.  There's been things that people have said, okay, fine.  There's been unintended presence.  And there is some conversation that settles that.  Right?  Or you take the legal challenge and let the courts sort of decide.   
So it's in that sort of a context of saying, is that, that is certainly a mechanism.  So I read the first question of, you know, what are those types of compensation mechanisms, and trying to, at least, to get those on the table for this afternoon's conversation to say, you have examples, you have already market, you know, commercial market actions.  You have some other legal pieces, so trying to, at least in my mind, to organize the conversation to say, let's get the inventory of what those mechanisms are.  Right.   
And two then, and the second questions get down to the operational components of, you know, is there protocols. I mean, what's the mechanism that would actually implement that compensation.  Do I have that read right?  Does that make sense?  Josette.  
MS. LEWIS:  I guess I beg to differ a little bit.  		MR. REDDING:  Okay.  
MS. LEWIS:  I read in that first sentence “what types of compensation mechanisms, if any.”   
MR. REDDING:  Yes, if any.   
MS. LEWIS:  And I think it is important to look first at the need, and the scale and scope of that need, because I think a very important thing that comes out of that, even if there's a decision that compensation mechanisms are necessary, it's very important, as you start looking at number two, to understand that level of need, so as to understand what type of public policy actions are important to facilitating, addressing that need, since it's not our job here to design private insurance mechanisms and private risk management that's based entirely on market systems.   
I mean, we could do that, but maybe someone will go off and start a new business based on being entrepreneurial from this committee.  But really, we're speaking to USDA.  And so it becomes very important to understand the details of that level of risk, so as to design the appropriate public policy response to that.  
So to me, I actually think it is important to keep that, if any, very much in the forefront of the conversation as we look at the level of need and then flow to what would the public policy response be.  
MR. REDDING:  And how do you, I mean, how do you determine sort of the “if any?”  I mean, that's where, the assumption is embedded in this question that it's there but based on the experiences that have been raised, there is the assumption that there is presently.  No?    
MS. LEWIS:  Well, honestly, when I read some of the background documents, particularly, for example, the Pew Charitable Trust's dialogue about coexistence, I mean, two companies that spoke to the issue of how they are managing it, Gerber Foods and Whole Foods, who have taken very strict policies on adventitious presence or having unintended GE events in their product chains, they take very strict positions on that.   
And from what I read, I did not interpret that they were asking for additional measures to take place.  They were describing the way they've managed those risks and deal with them from a market perspective.    
So I think it comes back to, I think, there is emotion behind the issue on both sides of the debate, and being able to sort through the emotion, we need to have a little bit more fact and a little bit more specifics about what those risks are, so that we can understand the appropriate types of responses.   
MR. REDDING:  I've lost track of who is the cue of \-- okay.  Leon, and then we'll come to Chuck.    
MR. CORZINE:  I was actually going to address it as Josette just did as far as, do not forget the part, if any.  We need to have the discussion, but I don't think we leave out that component as we go along.  And I think Doug is offering, and this is interesting, we could have a solution that the government really didn't.  It is maybe a private solution, rather than a government run solution.  And that's always a possibility, and sometimes better.    
And as we look at that, I think maybe some of this background work that we're going to do, you look at part of the cost or premiums cost, if you will, if we go down the insurance path is risk assessment.    
What type of, how tight a tolerance on the contract you signed is, you know, the tighter the tolerance the higher the risk.  So the higher the premium that you pay into an insurance policy.  For a lot of things it's that way.  
Car insurance in Illinois is a lot more expensive in Cook County than it is in Christian County.  And there's a reason for that.  So you have a lot of those kinds of things.  We want to include that in the discussion.  
One other technical thing that I, sort of technical that I think Greg and Daryl and Jerry and I found useful on the previous committees, we're talking about adventitious presence, and we're not talking contamination.  That was a word we kind of got rid of, because it isn't contamination.  Contamination is much broader.  
We're talking about adventitious presence.  And I really would like to see our discussion and our comments get us used to using that terminology, because it really is more appropriate.   Thank you.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Yes.  I'd like to just respond to one sort of issue about the scale of the problem.  I think it's worth realizing that there are issues for discussion that come to USDA in a variety of ways.    
So certainly as the organization that addresses the needs of all farmers, we certainly hear the views from various groups that are involved in this.  And certainly the views of some of the participants in agriculture, that there are issues around this, others that say the farmers are managing this very well.  
At the same time I think USDA has been part of a situation where there have been many legal actions around a number of biotech products, and the courts have, in fact, told us that we need to pay more attention to this issue.  So that is, in fact, a part of this process that says that we need to be looking to this kind of dialogue, and whether there are tools that will more effectively enable us to strengthen the ability of farmers not to encounter these sorts of situations.   
So that in addition to about the magnitude, USDA at least has sort of an additional view on this.  And that's in part from the desire to be able to encourage new products that are determined to be safe to come on the market.  Because I think we want to be sure that additional legal steps don't make it much more complicated and difficult for new products to enter the market.  
So sort of regardless of the, well, not entirely regardless, but the magnitude of the issue is sort of one facet of the way that USDA has to look at the problem.  
MR. BENBROOK:  Chuck Benbrook.  Mr. Chairman, another model for a compensation mechanism would be an indemnity fund.  In other situations where novel technologies about which the risk is uncertain have been brought forward, governments from around the world have asked technology developers to endow Pay and Due, some sort of indemnity fund, or hold insurance that would endow such a fund.    
So that is another model.  Whether it's the right model or the wrong model, I think we have to wait until we get a clearer share and sense of what sort of harm we're trying to protect against.    
And Leon, I really want to say this very, very carefully.  I don't want this to sound provocative at all.  But for those people in agriculture who are taking proactive steps not to have GE content in their crops, when their crops are contaminated, they do feel that's contamination.  		And I can understand how a conventional farmer planting GE crops, if some of their corn got an additional trait, I can see why they would just, they would consider that to be adventitious presence.    
But this, you know, I think that, I hope those of you from the conventional, the convention/biotech side will step back a minute and think about how these other people feel about it, because they feel quite passionately that they have a right to be able to grow food without these genes in it.    
And they see it very \-- they see it much like pesticide drift.  And, you know, clearly we wouldn't argue that a pesticide that drifts onto somebody's farm where it's not supposed to be, I mean, that's contamination.  It may not be hazardous contamination, but it's contamination.   
And Greg, going back to your question whether there are some other models.  And you brought up pesticide drift.  Well, I know pesticide drift policy really well.  And it is not a useful model for solving this problem.    
And in fact, it's kind of in as difficult a place as GE policy in that under federal pesticide law, it is the responsibility of pesticide registrants, when they seek their labels for a pesticide, to include label instructions that prevent what they call economic damage to private property.    
And to the extent that they don't do that effectively, and somebody makes a legal application of a herbicide and it drifts into somebody's grape vineyard and kills the grapes, the relief for that person that suffered that economic damage is to go to the applicator and ask for a compensation.  And if that doesn't work, then sue the applicator and usually the chemical company.    
It's a totally broke system.  It's very costly.  And with this new era we're getting into with more volatile, very biologically active herbicides getting sprayed on more and more acres, we have probably as big a train wreck coming on herbicide drift and compensation, how to deal with the scope of compensation on those cases, as we do genetic drift.  But there is no good model in the pesticide world for dealing with that.    
MR. REDDING:  All right.  Isaura, if you want to speak, and then we're going to take a five-minute break and begin with public comment.  And then we will resume this conversation.  Okay.   
MS. ANDALUZ:  Okay.  I just want to talk about, just quickly, that for example, this is an example that technologies exist.  So if I buy, if I get, let's say I get the insurance, and I get contaminated year after year after year, I mean, I don't see \-- that's why I think that, you know, if any, if any insurance should be required.   
What I think, you know, and this is maybe sounds really crazy to a lot of people, but is that, you know, if this technology can be controlled.  You know, like, we already have hybrid seeds that people develop.  And they make the male part sterile, so that way no one can recreate this seed.    
And so I think in some ways, that some of these companies, developers of these seeds that are causing some of these problems, you know, should go back and look and see if they can't make these seeds where they don't contaminate other crops.  
The other thing is, for example, we're talking about herbicide resistence, is that, for example, you know, now with the canola, it's a mustard, you know, the seed family, and that it now has crossed with, you know, the wild mustards.   
Well, you know, in New Mexico, we have certain mustards, mustard plant that is the host plant for the curly top virus.  So now if people can't spray Roundup, and they can't kill those weeds, what's going to happen is, now we know we are going to be losing our tomato and cucumber crops because of this infestation of a weed that got, you know, contaminated through the herbicide that's now Roundup resistant.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Thank you.  Let's take a five-minute break.  That will allow us to set up for the public comment.  We have a few folks signed up for that, and I'll have an opening comment to the public comment, just to set, you know, for the record, so everything knows what the rules are.  And then we'll resume our conversation here this afternoon.  Okay.  Thank you.  Five minutes.  
(Whereupon, at 3:03 p.m., a brief recess was taken.)   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Before I turn the microphone back to the Chair, I'd like to just introduce one more person to you who will be following the work of this committee very carefully.  And that is Max Holtzman who is over here, who is the Senior Advisor to the Secretary on Trade and Biotechnology and Food Security.    
So I wanted everyone to at least know that he is here.  He will be following very carefully what this committee is doing.  And since he wasn't introduced earlier, I wanted to do that before we turned to the public comment period.  Thanks.    
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Yes.  Okay.  I will also mention that I have to remember his exact title.  That's why I didn't \--   
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Mark is an advisor on organic and sustainable agriculture, whether that is for MRP or for the Deputy Secretary's office.  I'm not sure which.  MRP, their marketing and regulatory programs division of USDA, Mission area.   
 		MR. REDDING:  Great.  Thank you.  Now is the scheduled period for public comment, as provided under the federal advisory committee act.  Each person who has signed up will be given no more than five minutes to speak at the microphone, which will be the portable microphone in the back or front here, that Dr. Schechtman has.  
Just an important point here, please provide to   
Dr. Schechtman an electronic copy of your remarks, for the record.  We intend to post the text of your remarks on the committee website.   
I'd like to note to committee members that this is a time to receive comments from the public.  This is an important and mandatory function of the committee.  It is not, however, intended as a dialogue with commentators.   
In addition, I would like to note the public, for the public, that the AC21 website is being updated so that comments on the work of the committee may be submitted electronically at any time.  Dr. Schechtman will periodically note to the committee members by email the comments received, and remind members to look there, to look for them, and will summarize the status of electronic comments received at each meeting.   
So with that opening, let's begin with public comment.    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  There's a list there of two.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  First up, Michael Sligh.  
 		MR. SLIGH:  Sligh.   
MR. REDDING:  Sligh.   
MR. SLIGH:  Where do you want me to go?  
MR. REDDING:  If you don't mind, please use the microphone that Dr. Schechtman has.    
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. SLIGH:  Being from the south I get a little more than five minutes, because we talk slower.  Is that right?    
MR. REDDING:  All in five minutes.   
MR. SLIGH:  Okay.  I'll do my best.   
MR. REDDING:  And if you'd please introduce yourself, affiliation?  
MR. SLIGH:  Sure.  Thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony.  I am Michael Sligh.  I'm director with the Rural Advancement Foundation International.  We're based in Pittsboro, North Carolina.  We work with farmers in all four of these distinct farming approaches that have been identified here.    
I served on the founding body of this board that has led to AC21.  And so I thank you for answering this call to serve.  And I understand the sacrifices involved.  
I come from a long line of farmers myself, and farmed a decade as well, commercially.  So I understand these issues, both personally and professionally.  I do really appreciate the Secretary's focusing this conversation down to three strategic points.  I think that's critical.    
I also support the idea of tackling this compensation issue first, because I think that is at the heart of this question of shared responsibility, and who pays and why.  This is really the basis of real coexistence.   
I don't think it's so much of an issue of farmer against farmer, but really more a question about the technology.  And so how do we deal with a technology that may not and does not always stay put?  What do we do about that?  
I think the alfalfa conversation that happened last winter also put some other, another approach to compensation on the table.  And I urge the department to provide that to the committee as well.  I think that will be useful to look at multiple models of compensation.  
It is a jigsaw puzzle.  You have to put all these pieces together.  This is a very complex issue.  You can't, really, at the end of the day, bifurcate these pieces too much.  You really do have to see how they fit together.    
I think you should look at the canola case study as an example of what can go wrong and what needs to be done, and how big the scope can be.  I also think we need to look at principles of equity and fairness, and need to embed them into your thought process in terms of making recommendations to the Secretary.  Because a lasting coexistence will need to be based on those principles.  
I think that, I think there are four distinct groups in terms of the farming approaches.  I think you have to think about rice producers as being nonorganic, in many cases, non IP, but very conventional farmers who have a stake in this game.  And I would urge us to make sure that you recognize all four of these approaches, because they all  
have a stake and they all need to be heard, and we need to make sure we're covering all of these farming approaches in a fair way.   
I think in terms of the Secretary's second charge about implementing the mechanisms, I think you do need to be comprehensive in terms of the costs and the losses.  And I think you need to look at all segments of the supply chain.   
I think if you fail to look at all segments of the supply chain, you will fail to create a durable solution.   
You also need to recognize that the action tolerances or thresholds that may be applied need to meet both the market expectation as well as the market requirements.  Otherwise, again, you won't come up with a solution that actually works in the real world.   
I think in terms of the third charge, you need to look for some low hanging fruit.  The first board, we had a difficult time, to be honest, agreeing on the day of the week.  But we did agree on the need to reinvigorate public plant and animal breeding, and to ensure public cultivars are available for all farmers.    
I believe all farmers, regardless of the approach you're taking, would be happy and excited about improved, elite public cultivars that bring into their production system.  And so USDA needs to ensure, if you are going to have a choice, you really do have to have the cultivars available to give farmers choice.   
And then I think in conclusion, I think this issue of looking at the ongoing role and oversight of USDA, if you do, indeed, create a mechanism, you need to also address, what is that role?  How do you ensure that this mechanism and this implementation is happening in a way and can be evaluated in an ongoing manner so that it really does work long term.   
I would stress that coexistence is a two-way street.  And I think that peaceful coexistence can't really be achieved without fairness.  And I don't think fairness can be achieved without ensuring justice and shared responsibility.   
So I hope those can be part of your guide.  And I wish you well in this endeavor.  We're rooting for you to come to some strong consensus.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  Very good.  Thank you.  We have Conlin O'Neil with the Center for Food Safety.    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  While he's coming up, can I please ask everyone if you have cell phones or blackberries on, would you please shut them off.  They're getting a lot of static in the recording.  And it will make it much more difficult to figure out what the transcript is supposed to say.   
MR. O'NEIL:  Thank you very much.  Good afternoon.  My name is Colin O'Neil.  I'm the regulatory policy analyst for the Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit public interest group that supports sustainable agriculture, based here in Washington, D.C.   
We thank the Secretary Vilsack and the USDA for convening this advisory committee today, and look forward to participating in future AC21 meetings.  In the interest of time, I'll keep my remarks a little briefer than what I handed out.   
The committee's task is certainly not a small one.  Ag biotech presents many challenges, paramount among them, finding ways to achieve true coexistence of organic, conventional, and biotech ag.  
As you may know, the Center for Food Safety has been at the forefront of efforts in this area.  For years we have engaged in numerous USDA rulemaking procedures.  We've repeatedly urged the department to address the problem of gene flow from genetically engineered to organic and conventional crops with appropriate regulation.  		Unfortunately, our concerns have gone completely unaddressed, compelling us to take legal actions against USDA on several occasions.  No one likes lawsuits, including us.  They consume time, resources, better spent on finding solutions.  And we sincerely hope that this committee will truly find effective ones.  Yet please consider a couple brief remarks.   
Without our lawsuits, we, this very coexistence discussion you are embarking on probably would not be taking place, and the urgent need for this discussion is suggested by lawsuits of another sort.  
As mentioned earlier this morning, most recently, rice farmers underwent five years of litigation to recover hundreds of millions of dollars in losses they suffered thanks to the improperly regulated field trials of experimental GE rice, Liberty Link 601\.   
A decade ago regulatory breakdown with StarLink corn had similar consequences for midwestern corn growers.  Many other lesser transgenic contamination incidents have hurt organic and conventional farmers alike.   
So as you discuss the costs and difficulties of coexistence measures, please remember that the lack of appropriate regulation has tremendous costs as well.  Costs borne by hardworking American farmers.    
We would like to raise several key concerns for your coexistence deliberations.  First, coexistence measures must be designed to work consistently under real world production conditions, not just in carefully controlled field trials.   
Unpredictable weather, time and resource constraints can all lead to deviation from best management practices.  Thus coexistence measures must also be redundant and designed with ample margins of safety to account for the unpredicted realities of real world production agriculture.   
Second, enforcement of coexistence measures cannot be left to the seed firm, but rather must be the responsibility of the USDA or some independent and verifiable third party.  One cannot obviously expect or rely upon a seed firm to enforce contractual coexistence measures on its farmer customers.	  
Third, effective coexistence measures are impossible without consequences for noncompliance.  That means, biotech companies and growers must bear liability for failure to follow prescribed gene containment measures.  
At present, conventional and organic farmers are bearing the entire burden of protecting their crop from transgenic contamination, or suffering the consequences if they do not.  It's long past time that biotech firms and growers take responsibility for the impacts of their decision to market and grow GE crops.  
An illustration of the inadequacy of the current regime is provided by the Roundup ready alfalfa.  Please refer to the handout I've provided.  Despite very limited cultivation of this crop, and court ordered gene containment measures at the time, the Roundup Ready trait has been detected over 60 times in conventional alfalfa, seed lots, or feral alfalfa.   
While we understand that you have been asked to focus on coexistence, we also urge the committee to address other serious challenges raised by biotech and agriculture.  For instance, the unregulated cultivation of Roundup Ready crops has triggered an epidemic of glyphosate resistant weeds.  We also urge the committee to address herbicide resistant crops and the discussion of coexistence in herbicide drift, injury to neighbor's crops, as well as the committee's expertise needed to inform USDA's proposed revision of biotech crop regulations.  
CFS and 21 other groups recently sent six major recommendations to the final rule to Secretary Vilsack.  In particular, it is vital that the USDA make the use of genetic engineering the trigger for regulation so that all GE crops are reviewed by USDA.    
We also recommend mandatory measures to mitigate gene flow from commercial GE crops, and rejection of the proposal to legalize contamination of non-GE crops with unapproved experimental GE crops during in field trials.  
Finally, we note that an increasing number of growers are finding it difficult, if not impossible, to access high quality non-GE seed.  USDA should increase funding for public sector breeding programs to ensure that farmers who which to grow conventional and organic crops have access to high quality seed.  Thank you.    
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Thank you.  They were the two public commentors who had registered with us.  I think that's all, right.  Nobody else stepping forward?  Okay.  Again, to all of the public who was here, thank you for being here.  And to those who commented, we appreciate your comments.  They will be posted as well on the website.   
With that then let's pick up on the conversation.   
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. REDDING:  We have a hard copy of one, but please, for the two that commented, an electronic copy to   
Dr. Schechtman.  Okay.  Thank you.  Very good.    
Okay.  So when we broke, I think we were in this conversation about, you know, the two point charge.  And I've come to value these quick breaks, just because you get a chance to sort of reflect a little bit on the conversation in the room, and know that it's difficult with a committee this size, but I'll just say a room this size sometimes to have continued conversation to follow a trail, you know, of a comment, even though you say, I want to come back to that, in this setting sometimes it's difficult to do that.  
One of the conversations we had briefly was, you know, when you get to this issue of compensation, it has to be based on some standards.  Right.  And I want to ask Lynn, I mean, just to give some perspective, because it was in this vain of, you know, if this is in facts, it would have been one of the examples, you know, what's been the experience in the market place.    
And it gets to some of the points we've talked about here, that you really have to know, sort of, what are the standards for a particular crop to have an informed conversation about what, if any, that there is a need for compensation.  So Lynn, do you want to pick up on that?  
MR. CLARKSON:  Sure.  Lynn Clarkson.  Josette, I appreciated your focusing on the if any clause in the first charge.  When do we have a problem to even talk about?  That is largely defined by the market, and it is somewhat flexible.   
The standards around, well, if the standard were zero, we might as well go have a drink and leave.  This is open air agriculture.  So I don't believe that's a practical possibility.  In certain quantities you could probably get to zero, but for national agriculture, I don't think it's a practical possibility at all.  
As GMO's were first introduced into the world, we had Japanese clients that were putting in place their targets before the first ones hit the fields.  And they didn't have any idea, nor did we.  They asked us to help them write the rules.  And we had no idea what we could achieve.  So we started out with a 5 percent tolerance, which we've been able to reduce.   
Today, the tightest standards we see come from British grocery store chains which put GMO presence at one-tenth of one percent.  Anything above that is actionable, do something negative.  
The Japanese official standard is reasonably high. It's several percentage points.  But no Japanese company we know of wants to be deemed as bad as the Japanese government, so they'll tighten their standards.  So the Japanese have pretty much come to a nine-tenths of a percent standard, which is what you see in Europe for the labeling requirements on GMO.  And it is the standard, I believe, that the non-GMO project has adapted.   
You should know that what we see as an average, I know that people want to know what the range is, but the average on soybeans in the heart of the midwest where 97 percent of the fields are GMO, the average that we see when we're testing is less than one tenth of a percent.   
On corn, the average, again, is right around .5 percent.  Now, the ranges are significantly higher, but the averages are what I would regard at a manageable level.    
But now we inject new traits that have a significant impact at a level of one part in 10,000.  Whew.  We can't even practically test at those levels in the hurry of a harvest.  So we won't know we've got a problem until after we've had the problem.    
So there's quite a range here of reasonable tolerances, but without paying attention to the tolerances, we don't know whether we have a problem to address.  So I like your focus on the if any.    
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. CLARKSON:  I'm sorry.  Michael asked me the average of what.  We are looking in soybeans for any detectable GMO presence that we can find, strip tests, somewhere in the United States to use.    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  IP soybeans?  
MR. CLARKSON:  IP soybeans.  Almost all the soybeans we handle are IP.  Almost all the soybeans that, or a significant percentage of the soybeans we load into barges on the river are IP going to Western Europe.  So every farmer behind the scene knows he's being paid a premium for delivering within a tolerance.   
If we were buying out of the commodity flow, the percentages would be someplace above 90\.  But buying from farmers who wish to participate in selected markets, we're finding these .1, .5 in the average.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Mary-Howell.  
MS. MARTENS:  I'm an organic grain buyer, too, on a much smaller scale than Lynn.  But just a little bit of background.  When I reading that Pew report, and I read the stringency of Gerber and Whole Foods, what I saw reflected in that was eyes of farmers who had been expecting to sell into that market, and finding through no fault of their own, suddenly the loss of that premium dollar.  
When organic corn is rejected from the food market, it is often then downgraded to the organic feed market, because the feed market has a different set of standards, requirements.  But by doing that, that generally means a loss of $3 to $5 per bushel in value of that corn.  
If then that corn is downgraded from the organic feed market to conventional, that's probably an additional $3 to $5 per bushel loss of value on that corn.  Those are averages, but that's just sort of a structure of what kind of loss we're talking.  Hopefully Lynn will back me up on basically those.  I mean, it depends on the year.  It depends on the situation.  It depends on the location.  But there is a gradual loss of value based on what market is being sold into.   
So it's not a, in many cases, with a little bit of contamination, organic or non.  But there is that intermediary of the organic feed market, which is a reduction in value, but there's still an option there, because according to the national organic standards, it's still considered organic.  That's not the issue.  It's the market that's involved.  But that can mean a lot to a farmer.  That can be a lot of income to a farmer that they aren't getting.  
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Other comments?  No.  Laura, you had your card.  Did you want to say?  
MS. BATCHA:  Laura Batcha.  I'll just share.  I think one of the issues that Lynn raised is very important.  There are, when it comes to the export market for these crops, there are other countries, laws or regulations regarding thresholds.  And those can be easily documented.  We compiled it across all countries with labeling standards.  I can make that available to the group as a reference point.  But it's not the only reference point, because an overlay to that is often a tighter marketplace standard in addition to it.    
So I just want to distinguish between that in terms of the export market, which is often one of the markets that is most challenged by the presence of GMO's in the crops, unintended presence.  
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Marty.  
MR. MATLOCK:  Marty Matlock.  I just want to reiterate my support for a notion of a show impact approach, simply because the impacts are market driven, and those are going to change dramatically over time.   
I serve on the FAO committee for sustainable agriculture, and sustainable animal agriculture.  Both of those committees have adopted a principal for sustainability of technology/neutrality outcomes based.  Europe, I've worked with the EU on environmental programs, environmental monitoring.  There is a significant pressure to move away from precautionary principals in agriculture, and GM's in Europe as well.  So I'm no soothsayer, but I suspect that we'll be seeing a dramatic shift in purchasing thresholds there.  
MR. REDDING:  Chuck.  
MR. BENBROOK:  Mr. Chairman, Chuck Benbrook.  On the question of tolerances, thresholds, standards, from my read of the non-GE community, I think we're closer to general agreement on what some realistic thresholds are for both seed and seed purity, and consumer food products as embodied in the non-GMO project than many people realize.   
But the willingness of a broader cross-section of the non-GE community to get comfortable with those thresholds is a reflection of other concerns that are to one degree or another tangential to the actual market impact in a given year.    
And I think Isaura has done a good job of articulating one of them.  And on the question of seeds, because I've participated with a friend and colleague from Organic Valley that, a coworker with Missy Hughes along with Rhineheimer writing kind of a concept paper for seed purity from GE traits.   
And it became, as Lowell and I developed this and shared it with a lot of people, it became very clear that it makes, it will make a huge difference to the non-GE world if there is a firm commitment that there is a mechanism in place that's enforceable and will be backed up probably by the USDA in one, or the government in one way or another, to take strong action if and when the threshold is exceeded in seed and breeding germ plasm.   
In the absence of steps and mechanisms to prevent what's called creeping contamination by a lot of people, and in the event that it happens, to deal with it to, you know, get the genie back in the bottle, as it were, I think the discussion and process to reach agreement on thresholds will be much more difficult.   
So if we can package the discussion around thresholds with a mechanism to deal with circumstances when they are exceeded, and if people believe that there is a real mechanism there, we'll have a much easier time in reaching agreement on the threshold itself.    
MR. REDDING:  Reaction to that?  So if you're going to establish the threshold \-- pardon me \-- you start with the seeds.  But if there is some violation of that, there is a mechanism within the USDA to deal with it, right, enforce it?    
(Discussion off the record.)   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  For clarification, we might be talking in this group about thresholds, both things that have to do with seeds as well as things that have to do with commercial commerce of everything else.  But what you're specifically talking about here is the ability of farmers to get what they consider to be pure, high-quality seed.    
MR. BENBROOK:  Right.  The critical, you know, to ask people that are very worried about genetic engineering and the presence of GE traits in food, to ask them to buy into a policy framework that will make it easier to deal with the occasional contamination episode, adventitious presence episode that happens out there, is very much more difficult if we can't look them in the eye and say that there is, as well, a mechanism in place that's going to keep the problem from getting a little bit worse the next year, and a little bit worse the year after.    
And then we'll change the standards, and then we'll change the price of the insurance.  Just accommodate this creeping spread of GE traits through the food supply.    
And, you know, I think this is another technical question that I want to request a briefing on during AC21. Those of you who didn't read the Nasda-Pugh report, I strongly urge you, read the presentation by the pioneer guy, Giamara or something?  Mike Gumina.   
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  That would be Mike Gumina.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Yes.  Really, really interesting.  And I want to know, there is a table in there that has data on the percent of market penetration for a GE trait, an expected rate of outcross, and levels of contamination.  I want to know how much consensus there is in the genetics community on the data in that table.  And I want to know what the industry can do to change some of those parameters though best management practices.   
I really want, and I think we all need to understand that at a pretty deep level, because that's the first place the actuaries are going to go, to really figure out how much they might have to charge for this insurance.  So I found that a very provocative and useful presentation. And I'd invite one drawing on today's science which is, you know, we've got five more years, four or five more years of experience.    
MR. REDDING:  Good.  So where are we?  We'll go to Lynn.    
MR. CORZINE:  Leon Corzine.  I think, Charles, there is a Seed Act, and there are things that they have to specific purity that must be met, and it's tested and verified, or there are, I think and Angela you might help with this, and I know Lynn has been involved in some really pretty significant penalties if they are not met, that tell us what is in the bag when we buy it.    
Now, maybe that's a good starting place, Charles, because that is a pretty tight thing.  And \-- okay.  I was in on some discussion where how much you want to tighten that up and what the costs are going to be to all of us, no matter what our process is that we produce products.  Seed cost is significant.  And do we want to double or triple those costs.  I don't think so.  So you also have a cost benefit ratio within that, that also needs to be considered, if we head down that path.    
I really would like to go back, because we got cut a little bit short to the word contamination, Charles.  We did have a robust discussion about this.  And I do understand because I've grown specific products and I have had adventitious presence of other things come in.  Okay.   
But if you just use the word contamination, that can mean foreign material, that can mean insects, that can mean weed seed, that can mean aflatoxin, that can mean bunches of things.  And really, I think we need to be technical enough with this committee to use what is generally accepted as far as GE material, and it's adventitious presence.    
And we did have a robust discussion about that before; not to say that I'm not cognizant of adventitious presence and what it might do.  And Mary mentioned what the discount \-- what the, it's a premium is for the highest tolerance, or lowest tolerance and on down.    
So, you know, there are dollar values attributed to that, but I really think it is a more contentious word.  It is something that I think it would benefit our group and our public, the whole public reading of what we do, that we stick to those types of terms.  And adventitious presence is what we have used.  
MS. OLSEN:  Angela Olsen.  The 5 percent number I don't believe is correct, but what I'd like to do is get accurate numbers from my company and then come back to this group.  I just want to make sure that I'm giving updated and accurate data.  But I think those numbers are much lower.   
MR. BENBROOK:  I read the 5 percent in the plane in the review of the USDA agencies.  There is a thing in the seed act that says, adulterated seed can have up to 5 percent of something it's not supposed to have.  So I'm sure there's got to be stricter standards on varietal traits in the seed industry, I mean, way stricter.     
MS. OLSEN:  Absolutely.  And we're happy to bring those numbers back to this group as well.  There are numbers in the Seed Act, and then there is what industry does, which is generally those numbers are far below what's required in the seed act as well.    
So again, to give, to inform this group and to bring back accurate numbers, I prefer to, you know, come in, you know, check with the company, and then come back and give accurate numbers.  But I know that they are far below that number.   
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Thanks.  Barry.  
MR. BUSHUE:  I just wanted to comment on Leon's use of the term adventitious presence.  I would agree with him.  I think that as a professional committee, we need to use the terms of art, and the accepted terms of art.  And I think that if we're going to really talk about coexistence, and we're going to talk about, we need to start here.    
And I think while contamination is probably a very important term, if you are, if you feel as if your crop or something has been impacted by that, I think we need to rise above those more motive terms and stick with terms of art here so that we can accomplish this on a much more professional level than that.  I appreciate Lynn's comments.   
MR. REDDING:  Good.  Thank you.  Just looking at the \-- I'm sorry, go ahead, Laura.  
MS. BATCHA:  I think I'll just chime in on this discussion a little bit.  What might be workable for everyone, I think, is as a committee for our discussions, we're individual citizens and representatives of organizations.  It's America.  I think we have, all have the responsibilities and rights to choose the language that we choose.   
I think we'll defer to the chairman and the executive secretary who are charged with writing the formal recommendations for us, and react to their choice of formal language when it comes to that, perhaps, as a workable solution.   
MR. REDDING:  And I would just put a footnote to that.  I think the previous work of the committees, they struggle with some of these concepts and discussions and definitions and words.  So not speaking for Michael, but I think we're going to defer to the previous work, you know, and adopt those where we can.  Right.   
So AP is one of those good examples where, I don't know the whole history with that, but I can only imagine.  Right.  So if you've struggled with that, and have adopted that, and that's in previous reports of the committee, we certainly can and should continue that.    
Again, just a little bit of the conversation.  I feel like we've got pieces out there.  There are some thoughts.  We won't resolve this today, probably, right, even would be the preference of some to try to resolve it.  I just think there are components where, you know, we have to sort of think through, you know, how do we organize the work going forward.  Right.    
And I came into this thinking we could organize around the two point charge of the Secretary, in terms of work group.  And I don't know whether that sort of makes sense now, right, after I've heard some of the conversation.  Again, that can be for tomorrow.    
But I'm just trying to put out some initial thoughts.  Just because we have the standards discussion, you have some of the factual components, you have the if any clause, and just what that sort of gets us to, not that it's a separate piece, but I think it changes the complexion of that question considerably because you have to sort of back up and say, well, what if it's not there.  Right?  And that's a little different conversation.    
So I, you know, there's pieces there, and I'm open to suggestion in terms of how we begin to frame this up, even in terms of a summary, because I think some of the presentations tomorrow will inform the debate, right, and the discussion.  That will be good.  
But what do to you do with some of the items that were identified like the seed stock and the germ plasm?  Does that belong to this committee that currently exists and is charged with that?  And then to Michael's point earlier in the day about that division of labor?  That may well be one of those points that belongs to them when we should, as  a committee, recommend that they pick up that discussion.  Right?  The other committee, I'm drawing a blank on the formal title.    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  National Genetic Resources Advisory Council.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  But that's a point where, you know, I don't want to miss that, because I think that's a great conversation and helps to get to this compensation, potential compensation point.  But I don't know whether that's an area that we would need as a committee to tackle.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Mr. Chairman, Michael, did I hear you say that someone that's on that committee is going to be with us tomorrow?  Well, could I throw out the idea,   
Mr. Chairman, that we actually might formulate some questions or technical topics for them to wrestle with and report back to us, since it's likely that they're going to have a much deeper bench when it comes to plant genetics and microbiology than we have around this table.    
So the thought occurs to me that a couple of the things that have come up today might be quite useful topics for them to take up in the early part of their deliberations.  And perhaps Michael can schedule an opportunity for a couple of them to brief us at the next meeting, or whatever.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  My first reaction to that is, I think there is going to be cross-talk between the two committees.  But let me just make it clear that that committee is not subject to our setting their agenda.    
So we can certainly, as much as we might like, we can certainly share information with them.  We can tell them our concerns.  They will probably do the same for this committee.  And we want, we can certainly share the summaries of their discussions.  We don't have complete control over what they work on.  
We can certainly tell them that this committee thought that it was a very important topic, and probably was in their bailiwick.  But the Secretary is going to give them a charge, and they have a Charter, and within those confines, I'm sure they'll be very interested in hearing what we have to say.  And I suspect your view is not one that's held only by you.  So I suspect there will be people on the committee that want to know pretty much the same thing.  But we don't have quite the ability to do it in as direct a way.    
MR. BUSS:  Toward that end, if their meetings are, meetings discussions are available on the web like ours, it might just be useful to share that web address for members of this committee as a way to get informed.  If it's as catchy as that one, I don't think we'll probably find it.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  As you well know, our committee is actually easier to find than typing in that whole address.  And we'll certainly tell you a quick and easy way to get to that committee website as well.  	  
MR. REDDING:  Laura.  
MS. BATCHA:  Back to this discussion about whether some discussion around seed purity standard and enforceability of a seed purity standard is relevant to the work.   
I think there is a case that could be made that it would come under point two under what would be necessary to implement such a mechanism if the assumption was that a level of purity in the standard was necessary in order to then move through the crop production cycle with a reasonable risk profile for reaching an established threshold.  So I do think you could roll it under point two about what would be necessary.   
And then a thought that I have about this discussion about if any, because I think it's an important discussion that I think is not likely to be resolved, and even one or two meetings, perhaps, in terms of aggregating the data and debating that issue and trying to come to some sort of consensus on it.  
So one idea might be that we parallel track the if any discussion along side, presume, yes, and what would the models look like, and start getting some of that other work going at the same time so that we don't end up going through our three meetings just on the if any discussion, and never getting to the meat of the other matter.  So that would just be a practical suggestion.   
MR. REDDING:  Josette.  
MS. LEWIS:  I can agree to that.  But I would still offer, I think it would be very helpful to delve in our next meeting, perhaps, just one of the meetings, to really level off on what are the practical experiences in the diversity of industries both with the risk and currently managing the risk.   
What I've heard around the table both in our public conversation and frankly in some side conversations is, that we're not yet all in the same place in understanding the scope of that risk that we're talking about.   
Again, there's differences in levels of understanding about how immediate the risk we're talking about.  Is it that you didn't get paid a certain dollar value because you couldn't, you didn't meet a threshold for none-GM, versus long term risks in erosion of the germ plasm base that certain industries depend upon.  
Those are very different kinds of risks which you couldn't manage through the same kinds of mechanisms.  There's questions of more clearly defining what non-GM is, the idea of a standard around that, whether it's a market based standard or some clarity on public policy for a standard, from market standard, not a safety standard.    
So I think I've heard a number of still different places that we're coming from that is very critical to the scope of risk that we're talking about.  And I think even if you moved to looking at modalities for addressing those risks, still understanding some of the details of where the experience lies will help us inform a more robust system that can take us to the future.    
So I still think that I would recommend for our next meeting that we really delve a little bit more into the types of conversations we've heard from Lynn and Laura and others, Mary, and so forth, about this question of what risk actually exists in the market place and might be predicted in the near future.   
MR. REDDING:  Good point.  And I think with tomorrow's discussion with Dr. Greene and Dr. Fernandez will certainly help.  Right.  And maybe even, you know, point us as a committee in the direction in terms of what other questions we need to ask, and how, whether it be by work group or otherwise, we just try to get to that set of question of who actually has the information that can help us.  All right.    
I think that's going to be part of what we need to be thinking about for tomorrow.  And I ask each of you just to keep that in mind, that at some point here tomorrow as we get through the presentations, we've got to sort of gather up the charge and the conversation, and have some agreement in terms of what that next step looks like, in terms of both the agenda, but I think just in terms of structuring our own work, how is that best done.   
And I like the point, Josette, of the sort of parallel track that we would be on, right.  Because I think that's one of these points that we just, we're not going to know how they come together until we get down the road.  But to make good use of the time and then sort that out at a later point.  So good point.    
Other thoughts like that, that we just need to, at the end of the day here, put on the table?  And then we'll come back to them, of course, tomorrow morning.  But I'd appreciate any final thoughts.   
MS. ANDALUZ:  I just think it would be useful if we had some kind of a diagram or something of the things we're talking about to see how things are linked together.  That might be helpful, too.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  When we figure out all the things that have been talked about, we'll try to create a diagram.   
MR. REDDING:  They'd be the dinner exercise.  I think the table is big enough to lay those things out.  Comment?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Maybe a couple of comments.  Just some thoughts about how we might proceed.  And you can take them as just thoughts off the top of my head.    
The first is, if we are going to move, perhaps, to work groups that conceivably divide up into different areas some of which might be different mechanisms for compensation, I think for each of those sorts of groups that might be working on something, that each group is assigned to talk about the pluses and the minuses of it.  I think it's very important that in the rush to set up a compensation mechanism, we don't create a cure that's worse than the problem.    
So I think there needs to be a lot of that sort of evaluation of pluses and minuses if we're going forward in groups that are going to report back to this committee.  And I'm presuming at this point that because the subject is so big that there's going to be work for you all between meetings.   
I think the second point just sort of goes to having heard lots of recommendations from a lot of folks about presentations that might come in.  I guess my bias in  thinking about how the committee works is that all of you, having faced time with each other, is the most valuable use of your time.    
And to the extent that we can gather information and provide it to you, or members can, who have access to various sorts of information and can provide it, and have it distributed to members, and we spend rather less time on, or try to minimize the amount of presentation time that is not absolutely necessary and can share information in other ways, we'll have more time for the actual discussions.  And those are going to take up absolutely as much time as we have allotted to get to a conclusion on this.  
MR. MATLOCK:  To the issue of presentations, in other groups we've used webcast as a vehicle.  Sorry, Marty Matlock.  We've used webcast as a vehicle, so that not only do you have a synchronous presentation, but you have that also as part of the log of information for the committee, for the public as well.  So those recorded webcasts an be viewed by anyone at any time in the future.    
So you have the experts present with people, representatives who can participate in the webcast asking questions.  So you have dialogue as well.  It's not just a single discussion.   And therefore you can have a more comprehensive record of that sort of information without taking up local time.  Go ahead.  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Just sort of one response to that.  I think it's, according to my understanding of FACA, it's probably fine to have information that is distributed to members via a webcast that goes in one direction and is then put up on the web.    
But to the extent that you have a committee that is meeting as a whole and asking questions back and forth, that's a committee meeting.  It has to be noticed to the public.  And we may run into some FACA issues around that.  But I need to check into it.  
MR. MATLOCK:  Webcasts?    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  I need to research that.  I think in principal it's a good idea.  I don't know the details and the costs.  And we don't have any extra money in the committee budget.  I need to figure out all of that within our constraints.   
MR. MATLOCK:  Second comment goes to the question that I asked Secretary Vilsack at the beginning, which is how deep in the weeds do we go?  When we start talking about compensatory mechanisms, risk equals hazard times exposure.  		And we have a tradition in this country that those who cause exposure bear the responsibility for compensation.  And so that then implies a certain responsibility in this scenario.  Is that the level we're going to tomorrow?  
MR. REDDING:  Why don't you?  
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  I guess my general response, because I don't really know the answer to that question, is that it will be difficult enough to get the general principals down without digging into the weeds.   
I think you need to dig into the weeds only where not digging into the weeds would prevent you from making a terrible mistake because the weeds are informing the big picture.    
But to the extent that you can look at the big picture instead of working on the details, the more likely it is that we'll be able to get done.  I don't know.  That's sort of dancing around a little.   
MR. MATLOCK:  Well, I'm a university professor, so the weeds are on my landscape, so I have problems with it.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Chuck Benbrook.  Michael, I would much prefer to receive the more detailed information in writing before the meeting.  I have a five-hour flight.  I found the material that you put together for this very useful.  I thank you for that.  I wouldn't want to get much more.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  You will.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Well, no, much more per meeting, per meeting.  So if you can arrange for people in the department to get us this kind of information prior to the meeting, I think that would facilitate progress and give us more face time.   
I do think, in some, at some point, it would be very valuable.  And actually the best way to do it would be, send us the information in advance, but then have a technical expert or two here that, for a defined part of the meeting, that can help us if some technical questions come up.  So I just, I know we are often going to be stumped by some technical issues.  And to the extent that there is a lot of resources here in USDA, I think it would be useful to occasionally have some of those folks available.  I don't know what the FACA rules are.   
I'd just like to share a comment or an observation from, again, the Roundup Ready alfalfa experience that Missy and some of us, you know, Michael Sligh was involved with it, George Seaman, Michael McCastlin, Paul Frey from Cal West, Chet, what's Chet's last name \-- Boruff from AOSCA.  And Sharon was involved with that, and a guy from NAFA.  Who was the NAFA guy?  I can't remember.  And David Miller from Pioneer.    
As that group of people, you know, discussed and struggled with to try to come up with some recommendations to the Secretary prior to the Roundup Ready alfalfa decision.    
I would say a clear majority of us felt that we could have gone way farther in what we said to the secretary as a consensus of that diverse group had it not been for the precedents that some people felt might be set by how coexistence was dealt with in the context of the Roundup ready alfalfa decision, and that it was, in fact, concern about those precedents that really stymied our resolving, perhaps some of the core issues in alfalfa.   
Now, I've thought a lot of about that, and it's kind of, I think we missed an opportunity.  And my inclination is, if we can break this problem up into some smaller parts, and solve some of the small parts, I think it's worth us going down that road.   
Yeah, let's get some low hanging fruit.  You know, let's try to solve some pieces of this, because we'll \-- I think as a group we'll discover some principals along the way in doing that where we'll establish some trust and perhaps deepen our mutual commitment to try to see this to the end.   
So I'm for, usually I'm not into reductionist approaches, but for right now, I think it'd serve us well to try to look at individual crops and try to see if we can come up with some solutions that will fit those circumstances.    
And from that process, I think we \-- we're going to discover a couple of things.  We're going to discover some principals that apply everywhere.  And we're also going to convince ourselves that this is not one problem that we're solving.  It's a lot of different problems that will manifest in very different ways, including many ways that we have no way to predict.   
So in effect, the Secretary is asking us to help conceive of a policy framework to solve problems about which we don't really know what they are.  We have a general idea of what they might be.  And that's obviously a difficult assignment.   
But I do think that if we focus on some of the individual crops, and some of the easier things as a group, it will serve us well.   
MR. REDDING:  Great points.  Doug.  
MR. GOEHRING:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Doug Goehring.  One of our big challenges here, and I think the Secretary laid it out properly when he looked at, what are those compensation mechanisms.  And then again, the second point of that being, what are going to be those thresholds. And then third, what would those appropriate actions be to facilitate coexistence.   
Just so we don't, or at least this is my belief, we as producers, and I'm taking this from the farmer's point of view, look at situations, and we try to define it, break it down.    
And quite frankly, I'm afraid if we move down this road of trying to identify what those protocols would be, what the thresholds are before we even identify the mechanism, it's kind of like buying the tires and the transmission and the stereo, and we don't know what vehicle we have yet.  I think we've got to identify the vehicle, then put those components into it.  Then we can drive it down the road and start figuring out those other issues.   
So as we move forward, at least I believe that maybe what we should be looking at is probably identifying what mechanism we're going to suggest or advise and see how we can develop that from that point on, because whether we're talking about thresholds that are established by USDA, or by the market, we're going to have to identify those after we determine what vehicle they actually have in place and how that may work in the real world.  And then at that point, move onto the last issue which gets us into the other realm.   
And I just mention that because I'd hate to spend a whole lot of time talking about those other areas when we need to address that part too, the starting point.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  What's that?  
MR. BENBROOK:  Chuck Benbrook.  I think Doug is, you know, he's raised a really important question.  Where should we start our work?  Tires, transmission, engine,  stereo.  I'd go with the stereo.  You know.   
And my inclination is different from Doug's in that I think putting some effort into documenting the economic harm that's happening out there, the circumstances, how one would quantify it, just to \-- you know, I'm not an expert in crop insurance or anything, but to my logical mind, getting a handle around that would make sense before we start talking about mechanisms and standards and criteria.  But, you know, hey, I'm committed.  I'll go with whatever car we want to design.    
MR. REDDING:  Mary-Howell.   
MS. MARTENS:  On the news this morning I was watching the devastation of Vermont, of the flood, and one of the things that was said was, because floods in Vermont are not very common, very few people have flood insurance, and therefore these farmers are not likely to be covered.  
I think we need to identify what risks there are before we start building the compensation measures, because if we don't identify the risks and the source of the risks, we end up having to sort of fit the measure, the compensation onto something that may not fit very well.  So respectfully, I think I would do it just the opposite.   
MR. GOEHRING:  Mr. Chairman, Doug Goehring.  The only reason I mention that is because none of us in this room have the expertise to know about how those risks were put together.   
And when I look at it from an insurance point of view, we have those companies out there that have the actuaries to do the work.  And they develop and they take the hard data and work from that point.   
So I make the point that if we design or we ask for the concept, and we tell them kind of what parameters we want to work within, they can start working around that development.  They pull the hard data and they work from there.   
And you're right.  They are going to want to look at what hard data exists, what those risks are, because that's their business.  And they will move in that direction to identify what those risks are so they can establish what the premiums are going to be, and how they are going to cover all those risks.    
So I mention it from that point of view only because we don't have the expertise to dig that far into it when they have the computers, they have the individuals and the ability to do that.  And in the same respect, if we move towards an indemnity fund, then we have to start from a different level, which is accessing other agencies, other peoples, contractors to help develop what that risk is, and then work from that point of view.    
But there's multiple ways to approach this.  Those are the only two that I am aware of.  And there's different ways to approach those once you get into them.  Thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  Laura.   
MS. BATCHA:  It's Laura Batcha.  I agree with Mary-Howell in terms of approach, for a couple of reasons.  I think my understanding of the charge is, as the Secretary said, to not really get too bogged down in the construct.  So I don't really see this group going out to developers of insurance products and having them run actuarial models.  
So I think we need to do a little bit of work on the risks, the real risks, the costs and the sources of the risks to help inform sort of where those splits in the road are.  So that's where my instinct leads me.   
And I think, because at this point in the conversation, you know, I will be frank, I am very, I'm hesitant about too quickly picking the path of the insurance model.  And I speak from the perspective of the stakeholders that we represent at the Organic Trade Association.    
And we have worked very hard since before the 2008 farm bill to try to get some sort of reasonable parity in terms of crop insurance and the way it works for organic farmers to begin with.  And I think that there's an inherent hesitance on the part of the organic production sector to fully embrace crop insurance as a model that is currently working without having that be the solution to this issue.  
So I have, I'm just putting that out there because I have that in the back of my head.  There is current premiums for organic crop insurance.  We've been very challenged in terms of the work, in identifying the data that will satisfy the actuarial models in terms of the high rigor for actual data at the county level to do that.  So I'm hesitant that we could totally get through that path as a committee.  
MR. REDDING:  Yes.  Listening to \-- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  
MS. ANDALUZ:  Isaura Andaluz.  A lot of times I work with a client to say, let's just do a brain dump.  And I think it's kind of like what we need to do tomorrow, is just kind of pull all these ideas out.   
But I think if you look at this, I think maybe the first thing is like what Chuck was saying, then what are the economic losses, and then what are the necessary mechanisms to stop these losses.  And I think out of that, then you can see, you know, what needs to be done, you know, is it going to be fun or whatever.  And maybe it will be something totally different that we haven't even thought about.  So I think that would be a good way to maybe start.    
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  Perhaps I can just make one suggestion.  I think we are having this debate, and I think it's all sort of a matter of degree of how much information we gather on which topic before we figure out how we're going to divide stuff up.  
And I think we would be better informed as to what the needs are of the committee after we hear the presentation tomorrow from ERS about information that has been collected at this point on the relative risks and rewards and concerns.   
So I think it's a useful discussion, but I think in part we'll be able to revisit this discussion with a bit more information tomorrow.   
MR. REDDING:  I agree.  It sort of goes with the point earlier, though, about the scope of risk.  And I think certainly Dr. Greene and Fernandez can speak to that.  You know, because we've got to sort of identify these major components.    
And they may all be on parallel tracks, right?  It's not just the first part of the compensation and the if any clause.  But looking at the economic harm, breaking down, you know, some of these points, into more manageable components and saying, is there some role for the committee to really look at that, or some work group to look at those pieces, that would help us both inform, you know, the numbers, one and two.   
And then for each of us, we're thinking about what those general principles are, right?  What are the principles, right?  Even once we have the data, or a little further information tomorrow, you know, what are the general principles that will guide how we approach the menu of compensation mechanisms.  Right?    
What are the general guiding principles that we want to set forth to the Secretary that would be in keeping   
with his charge to us to not get all the way in the weeds, but help him fix this problem that's been carried to the USDA of, you know, exploring in some detail the compensation mechanisms.  
What are the general principles around that?  I mean, it's part of protocol. It's part the experience.  It's part the, you know, the current market place.  So just helping, helping us think that through.  I think that will be part of the homework assignment for all of us, just thinking about what those general principles would look like that would fit into number one, and would fit into number two.  
They are general points that as we build this equation for fixing, potentially fixing, or at least recommending to the Secretary of how to approach the fix, that we would want to see considered under numbers one and two.   
And that gets to, you know, themes of this conversation about, you know, what the risk is, what the harm is we're trying to address.  Does that make sense?  I mean, I know that's in some respects sort of ambiguous.  But I'm trying to sort of get to the bigger principal components and then build down once we have a little more insight from those who are tracking it.    
And we have some documents that would come from industry and others who are monitoring what those problems have been, and what the standards, and so forth, and get that together.   But all of it would feed into these general principles.    
So if we could approach our work that way, I think tomorrow then we can sort of jump into these more specific conversations from staff and we can use that, Chuck, to think about sort of what else would be helpful, and Marty.  		You've both made comments about having access to other people, other information, and other experts and so forth.  And where would that and who would that maybe look like.  But again, framing it around these general principals and who holds that type of market intelligence that we would want.  Is it the insurance companies?  Is it, you know, some of the underwriters in the private sector?  Who is it?  			Other points we want to put on the table?  I'm sorry, did I miss \-- yes, sorry, Missy?  
MS. HUGHES:  I just wanted to followup on what you were saying.  Sorry, Missy Hughes.  I think this question of identifying the principles is critical.  Just sitting here, you know, I was thinking that we're going to have some nuts to crack when we talk about this whole idea of compensation.  		One of them would be private versus public.  Another is going to be, who is going to pay.  And I think that what we're finding among the group is, we want to debate those questions right away.  And we want to talk about, well, are there you know, is there a market loss or not?  And I want to know the data behind that.  
And I think what we need to do, and maybe this is just echoing what you're saying, is discipline ourselves to just put those things on the table, and recognize that there will be debate about those, and we don't have to put our position or our stakeholders position on the table at the same time.    
Let's just, as Isaura said and as you said, dump everything onto the table and then we'll say, okay, for the next hour we're going to talk about who's going to pay.  And then you can, you know, put forward your position about that, and we can kind of establish that.  But at least let's get those pieces onto the table, and then, you know, we might all just run away screaming, but at least we can start  
it.   
MR. REDDING:  You've said it better than I could, so thank you.   But it's getting those points out there, you know, of really coming to some agreement as to what this principle should be as we move into building what a mechanism should look like.  Right?  If any.  And I keep, this is my if any friend.  I keep saying if any.  He writes it down.  So I look to the end of the table, there is if any again.  But if any.  
It's a good point.  I want to run past that, but it's a fair point.  We have to say, if any.  If you do it, what does it look like, and what are the guiding principles upon which you want to make that decision.  It's a fair question.  Is it certain protocols?  Is it the averages?  Is it what's happened, and so forth?  But let's put that on the table.  Right?  So that will be a good conversation.  I'm sorry, did I miss \-- Alan.    
MR. KEMPER:  Get Daryl.  
MR. REDDING:  Daryl, please.   
MR. BUSS:  Well, also, I think for us, just in terms of thinking, looking at the first question, if any aside, it seems to me what the Secretary is asking for is a menu of options.  We've tended to focus as though we're going to develop a mechanism, singular.  That's not actually what we're asked to do.    
We're asked to give him, my reading, is to give him some options for him to evaluate, and the department to evaluate in terms of moving forward.  So again, I don't think we should feel necessarily compelled to drill down all the way to one singular mechanism, unless it turns out that's literally all we can find.  That's fine.  But I don't think we should start there.  
MR. REDDING:  That's a good point.  I mean, types, it says, what types.  It's plural, so a very good point.  Alan?  Sure you do.  Go ahead.  
MR. KEMPER:  Thank you, Mr. Chair, for the encouragement.  Alan Kemper.  Kemper Farms has been around since 1888, as I said this morning.  I have two or three dilemmas being a newcomer to this group.  
One is, if a farmer or anybody comes in, moves in next to me and acquires 40 or 80 acres, what they do with their property may or may not affect my operation.  If they do it legally, ethically and whatever, there is no problem.  But it does infringe.    
It's no different than private property rights when you talk about air rights in real estate.  It does affect the next adjoining property owner.  The same way if I bought maybe right next to an organic farmer, I may or may not affect their livelihood by what I do with that.  
So then if that's the case, and I have my organic, if you will, car driving down the road, and my GE car driving down the road, both of them have to have insurance protection, one for liability, in my opinion, just for their sake.  The other one has to have insurance because they don't know if the other guy has insurance.   
So at the end of the day, this simple farmer from Indiana still says, there's probably a shared responsibility here that we all need to work on a compensational package with that.  And I agree with the philosophy of keeping it up higher than down in the weeds.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
MR. REDDING:  Good point.  Very good.  Yes?  
MR. JOHNSON:  David Johnson.   
MR. REDDING:  David.  
MR. JOHNSON:  Under the first item, there are the two words, unintended presence.  And I think we should keep track of what all of those are.  It could be a farming practice.  It could be a commingling.  It could be pollen flow.  It could be any number of things.    
And so as we debate this and we use different terms, I like the words that are chosen there, unintended presence.  And as we look at these different mechanism options, we keep that in mind, because there's a lot of different ways unintended presence can occur.   
MR. REDDING:  Keith.  
MR. KISLING:  We haven't talked \-- Keith Kisling, Oklahoma.  We haven't talked very much about the international trade, our overseas markets, a little bit today but not much.  And in wheat, that's pretty important.  That's 50 percent of our market.  
Wheat's a little different animal in that you eat it direct, so if and when we do get GM wheat, it's going to be pretty important for where are overseas markets are at, and what thresholds that we're able to handle.  
And we haven't talked about that very much, but I think sometime during our discussion it might be pretty important to know what threshold our overseas markets will allow, because in Taiwan, when I was there, they have the science and expertise now to pick out one soybean, GM soybean, in a whole shipment of wheat.  They know that we don't have GM wheat, so we're okay yet because it's still stamped on the corner of our export sheet, we're not GM wheat.  But we are going to be GM wheat.  And our producers are all wanting GM wheat.  And they've come a long ways. There's a lot of work going on in that area.  
Somebody mentioned, I think Leon said, yeah, you're going to be it one of these days.  And we are right now.  We're not organic.  We're not GM.  We're in the center here kind of riding the fence at the present time, but it's going to happen.    
So we need to be in this discussion for the long haul.  And I really think that my thought to start with was, we need to come up with some thresholds that we can live with.  We can't live with zero tolerance.  I don't care.  There's no way you can ever live with zero tolerance.  But somewhere we need a threshold percentage that we can live with, and when we come up with that, it might be advantageous to use some information we get from our overseas markets of what they would stand for.   
MR. BENBROOK:  Chuck Benbrook.  Well, Keith, I was going to maybe not say this, but you really prompted me to do it, because it's something I've thought a lot about, and I think it really underscores why the Secretary has gone out on a political limb to reconstitute this committee and try to deal with this.  And again, I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who's kind of been in the crossfire over this issue for a long, long time.   
One of the \-- there's a lot of collateral damage that's occurred in how we've dealt with agricultural biotechnology in the United States in the last 15 years.  And there are, there are, I think, interests in our broader community that are perfectly content to increase the amount of collateral damage, if necessary.   
And one of the, two of the themes, and two of the tactics that have really worked is to share information, whether it's right or not, with overseas buyers, with the hope that it, you know, to put it bluntly, scares the hell out of them over buying crops from the U.S., GE crops from the U.S.    
And we see this now playing out in the organic community where we have people in our tent who are, who feel so strongly about genetically engineered crops and unintended presence, or however we want to call it, that they are saying to consumers that because of a little bit of Roundup ready gene in some alfalfa that a dairy cow eats, that you shouldn't be, there's no value in Organic Valley organic milk anymore.    
And this ratcheting up of the effort to spin the facts, and these tough issues that we're dealing with, in a way that it drives up somebody's negatives, you know.  If you're trying to export wheat to Japan, you know, you can drive up your negatives by getting stories placed in the Japanese media.  People know how to do this.  There's a lot of people that are very good at it.   
And what worries me is that this has become the way that we try to fight through these issues.  And, you know, I think the Secretary has been quite articulate and actually moving in some of \-- I've heard him talk about why this is important three times now.  And I think he senses that if we don't find a way to turn this around, we're going to really start cutting into muscle, really start cutting into muscle.   
And I actually hope that people from both the \-- the hardliners from the non-GE world, and the GE world, can become convinced that by backing away from the arms race, and by arms race I mean, it's a PR “let's see how we can scare people” kind of an arms race.  By backing away from that, I think we can build all of agriculture in a way that is really in the best interest of the country.    
And I really think, you know, the Secretary kind of intimated, I mean, this is, we're going into an area where there will be a lot fewer government resources.  And not just at the federal level, at the state level too.  So to the extent that we know there are some big problems coming, we have to find ways to manage this, and we have to find ways to manage it with less money.   
So to me, that really highlights the urgency and the importance of us staring this beast in the face, calling it what it is, and seeing what we can do about it.  And that's why I'm glad to be on the committee, because I think, you know, for the next \-- we've got a short period of time, maybe two years, before \-- there's not a lot of new traits in the pipeline.  Hopefully there's not a lot of new disasters that are about to befall us from GE crops.    
But you know, I think three or four or five years from now it's going to be much more complicated and difficult to deal with it.  So I think we have a window of opportunity at a time when, you know, as a country we are really losing the ability to work together and govern.  I mean, look what they are trying to do on the hill with the budget.   
And I just think it would be incredibly important if we could find a way to break out of the log jam and solve even a few of the small problems, because it's just so rare now for any public process involving this kind of issue in agriculture to do that.  So this is my, you know, I guess this is my plea to the committee, is that we need to get to the hard stuff soon, because even if we get to it soon, it's still going to be hard to work through it.   
But let's not \-- I think we should be motivated by how much we could gain if we can start to create a different set of incentives and motivations for how we deal with this kind of a problem.  Because I don't see much else, you know, many other efforts that could have the same impact.   
MR. REDDING:  Thanks for putting this back into focus.  Well said.  I mean, I think, you know, certainly these are complicated.  And I think the Secretary is to be applauded for reactivating this group.  And, you know, it would have been just as easy to stay out of it, right, in many respects.  But he's chosen to get back into it.    
And I think it's in this world response of, you know, leading, taking the lessons learned in the last couple of years; understanding there has been a void there that's been filled by some for their own benefit on top of that. 			You know, quite frankly, it's a conversation we have to have within production agriculture, about how do we manage our own industry, and the perceptions of that industry, and the responsibilities we have to those who are in that business.  Right.  And that's a part of the conversation.  	  
I mean, that has to be on the table in terms of how we, as individual producers, treat the neighbors, and what they choose to do.  Again, if it's their unintended presence of a problem, we need to have a mechanism to deal with it. I think that's what the Secretary is now saying, after you sort through all of that, you get down to this point of, okay, let's assume for a moment it happens.  Help me design what a system, a mechanism would look like.  Right?  
How do I arrive there?  I think that's our charge is really saying, you know, what are those pieces, again, that we would want to have factored in that arrive at a mechanism, so he can respond appropriately, the USDA can respond appropriately to those who are raising questions about, what are you doing, Mr. Secretary.  But you can give a credible answer to that.  
And I think that was helpful conversation, because it sort of brings back into view that there is a sense of urgency about this.  It's hellish complicated, just by the topic.  But I think for us, we've got to be thinking about how do we take this and then break it into workable pieces for the committee and for the work group.  So thank you for that.    
MR. GOEHRING:  I'll defer to Mr. Kemper, my colleague, and then I'd like to comment after he does.  
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  Good.  And then we'll pick up with Lynn.   
MR. KEMPER:  Thank you, Mr. Chair, and Doug, for 30 seconds worth.  I wanted to respond a minute to Chuck, because at American Soybean Association we always realize there is an unwritten contract with society.  And it involves organic, sustainable, conventional monitoring, and GE crops.  
And we in American agriculture have the necessity to deliver it to them, and allow them to choose.  I mean, you'll see me at an organic market usually every Saturday, or a farmer's market.  And I'll choose various products, because my wife's a nurse, and I'll bring them home on a Saturday.   
And so my point is, we've got to get our kind of labels behind us, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, and work on a few crux issues that the Secretary has laid out.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
MR. REDDING:  Thank you.  Doug.  
MR. GOEHRING:  Mr. Chairman, Doug Goehring.  I'd like to echo the three previous speakers, Alan, yourself, and Chuck.  We do see an escalation of a demonization within our industry to elevate or promote one's self.  And it's dangerous.    
And I know in our state I've taken the stand to work within that organic industry to make sure we're representing everybody's view and trying to get to the best point possible so everybody has the ability to market fairly, and be out there producing it as best they can, given the numerous challenge that exists in production agriculture.    
I wanted to go back to point one.  And it was something, Michael has stepped out of the room, but he brought it up earlier, and I think it's the main reason why the Secretary, who has told me this also last fall, the reason he truly wants to look at a compensation fund, is simply because the courts have deemed that there is not adequate or just compensation in the event somebody had a problem.    
So if we come back to that, I think he laid it out nicely when he talked about having that compensation mechanism put in place, develop those thresholds, look at those things, consider them, and then talk about those other factors when you are going to look at mitigating risk.  And I believe that will probably be another great topic for this group.    
But if we think about it, if we were going to try and develop or design policy rules and regulations for everybody to live by, it would be very, very difficult, because you're looking at federal versus state versus local.  And I know that even within our state, the one thing that I will do on a continual basis to make sure we're addressing those local needs is, don't try to step on the local needs.  Let them really get their hands around their geography, their topography, microclimates, the species that they grow, produce, and address that.   
I think if we overall provide some guidance in that direction, it helps them in a dialogue.  For example, picking different maturities, and understanding the biology of plants, and addressing when they may pollinate and how you could have some problems establishing buffers.  I mean, there is so much that can be done, that maybe we can help them start that dialogue.  But I think to create that overall system for them would be not only very difficult, it would probably be somewhat dangerous.  But thank you.   
MR. REDDING:  Lynn.  
MR. CLARKSON:  Lynn Clarkson.  Keith, I'd like to address some of your questions, a couple of your questions about the international market.  We, must of what we do here is being defined by controversy.  And we have a national controversy going on right now where a major biotech provider is suing a major grain company, because the major grain company is saying, I don't want any of that product in my system because I serve China.  And China hasn't approved the event.   
So now we get down to whether it's an approved event, or one that the foreign country or foreign neighbor has yet to approve.  On those occasions, I think the standard is going to be zero.  Whether it should or shouldn't, I'm not saying.  But realistically, I think most countries are going to absolutely expect us to have approval in their country before they let even one kernel in.   
And for those of us in the green trade, if you are contemplating having an entire ship blocked, loading 50,000 metric tons, sitting someplace that you have to pay the mortgage on, is a phenomenal problem, when you really are trying to do things right to start on.   
And now we have one company saying, no, you buyers don't have the right to decide what you're going to buy.   It's been approved in the United States.  You have to buy it.  I think that would be terrible public policy.  I hope the courts disagree with that.  
With respect to trying to put a little hanging number in front of you, I would say, if we adapted or adopted, we for a time appoint 9 percent standard, that would fit almost every country that is trying to deal with these things.   
I would also point out that we are not the only players in coming up with GMO policy.  There are other countries struggling with this too, notably the Chinese.  And knowing some of their seed developers and their relationship to U.S. seed developers, I would say, they're looking at us to see how we do it, because they've got similar concerns for optimizing choice and diversity in their own country.    
And it's an open world.  If they grow something that's not approved here, it will be here.  It will get here in a container.  It will be, sometime it will be here.  We won't just have perfection on this.  
So our foreign markets are absolutely vital.  I think it's the individual seed company's requirement, burden, to get approval in a foreign country.  But I think the buyer has to have open choice about what to buy.  
MR. REDDING:  Very good.  Mary-Howell.  
MS. MARTENS:  As we fill the table up with ideas, I want to throw out another one, just because I think it's important, especially if we start talking about the insurance model.    
On an organic farm, we have identified a set of strategies of protection, of buffer strips, of altered planting, of timing, all of that.  A similar set of strategies for containment needs to be developed for conventional GE farms, where there would be tools that could be used again.    
Buffers; putting the refuges on the perimeter of the farms; perhaps working with neighbors about pollination timing; different strategies so that two adjacent farms could coexist with mutual respect, both taking proactive steps to avoid the end result.  
I mean, again, we can use all sorts of birth control analogies, but the bottom line is, do we have a contamination issue in the end.  It takes two.  It takes protection.  It takes containment.  But I think the more tools we get out there, the more tools that we teach the farmers and proactively promote, the better the result is going to be.  
So, you know, this goes down to number three, but I think any good insurance adjuster is going to go out to the farm and say, okay, there has been a contamination.  There's been an AP issue.  What have you done before to avoid this happening.  And the more tools that farmer A and farmer B can show that they did proactively, the better the case is going to be that this was just an accident.    
MR. KEMPER:  Mr. Chairman, may I ask Mary a question?  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Just a question, as I try to understand on this.  Does that happen there locally through mandates, or nationally through mandates?  
MS. MARTENS:  I don't know because I haven't seen it happening.  But I think it definitely has to happen locally between neighbors, but I think that this could be   
part of the stewardship program that biotech companies encourage their farmers to adopt, that it could be part of that package of requirements.    
I don't know how well those are being followed now.  I don't know if additional ones were added in that could happen.  But it doesn't hurt to try.    
MS. HUGHES:  I like the idea.   
MR. REDDING:  Please.   
MR. IHNEN:  Darrin Ihnen.  If I could just address this a little further.  You know, I've grown seed on my farm in the past for a seed company, and the first thing we did was talk to our neighbors.  And if it didn't work, then we were responsible for our own buffers.  But we were paid a premium for that product sold by us having our own buffers.  We were rewarded.  And so that was the risk/reward.  
And so on a national policy level, I think it's better off to take care of it locally.  You know, from your description of what you get for your crops, you are getting a reward.  And so, you know, that's part of the risk.    
And I guess just, you know, I think it would be much easier just to talk to your neighbors and work through the strategy that way, than to come from a national policy, because we know, as growers, what happens when policy gets developed here and it gets pushed on our farms.  It doesn't work.  We don't like it.  And it just ends up being a train  wreck a lot of the times.  
And so I, you know, I understand your situation, but if you can talk to your neighbors, it seems like a logical place to start.  And, you know, when we were growing those premium crops, we carried a premium insurance.  We paid more for that, but our reward justified us carrying that insurance back to us.   And so do your earlier comments about insurance.   
You know, I couldn't force my neighbor to insure my crop.  I had to do that in my own way.  That was, mitigated my risk.  And so I like your ideas on the insurance side.  But again, I can't force my neighbor to insure my crop.  And so that's just another topic for discussion.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  I think I want to just step in for a couple of points.  I think there was a comment, it was just sort of related to me, about that there had been something that suggested that I said that the courts had said that adequate compensation is not in place at this point.   
And I want to just sort of correct that, if I can, a little bit.  What the courts have said, said to us, is that in our environmental analyses, looking towards examining the impacts of potential regulatory actions on products, that we had not looked carefully enough at some of the environmental, the economic impacts.    
The courts did not tell us that there had to be a compensation system in place.  So I just wanted to get that on the record, since it's on the record.  
The other thing I wanted to just offer an unsolicited opinion on is around the question of understanding what other countries are doing in terms of thresholds.  I think there's a lot of useful information there, but I think it needs to be teased out very carefully because countries have thresholds for a whole host of different things, some of which have to do with their mandatory labeling requirements; some have to do with commercial standards.  And it's very easy to get all of that information sort of agglomerated into one not well understood mess.    
So I think, you know, there is information that we can certainly provide you, but we have to sort of be careful about how we think about that, how it's used, and also I would just sort of caution the committee, while it's nice to see what other countries are doing, and we want to be cognizant of that to help us in our trade, I think we want to be careful not to condition what we do on the practices of other countries, because those will be changing.  And if we make that connection, we will be sort of at the whim of what they do more than we need to be.   
MR. GOEHRING:  Mr. Chairman, Doug Goehring.  My apologies, Michael.  I did not mean to imply it in such a way.  It was an interpretation which I took out the courts suggested or at least recognized that the economic impact or economic harm had not really been adequately addressed.  
MR. REDDING:  Okay.  So here's the homework.  Don't do homework?  There's just a couple of points.  If you were asked to just sort of summarize today, I mean, just think about sort of what those three points would be.  All right.  I mean, we're all going to have conversations coming out of that.  And I've made a lot of notes.  But just in our own mind, think about, you know, what those three points, if you were to summarize today's discussions, what would they be.   
Two, think about the general principles to guide the menu of compensation mechanisms.  What's that menu and what are those general principle s to help for tomorrow?    
Three, be thinking about the work groups, again, not prejudging that.  And then I share with you sort of my thoughts, just taking the two points, and they would be work groups, but after today's discussion I think it's a different model.  So be thinking about what those work groups would potentially look like.   
And final point, just on the unresolved issues, we said we would, you know, capture those as we go through the conversation.  We have four on the board here today.    
Again, as you review your notes and think through the conversation, have we missed something that really belongs on the unresolved column that we want to come back to that may not fit into the three points that the Secretary has laid out.  But they are certainly important to us, and we want to continue those conversations.  So that was sort of the, you know, the homework, to be thinking about that.  Okay.   
I want to end where we began.  And that was with a simple thank you to each of you for giving up what you're doing in your professional lives, and personal lives, and school starting, and all those kinds of things happening, and you are here giving the USDA the benefit of your good thinking.  So thank you for doing that and being in this conversation in a civil way.   
I mean, one of the challenges we've lost as a society, I think, is our ability to have a civil conversation.  Right.  And we need that.  We need that desperately.    
And this is one of those issues within agriculture we need to maintain our civility and stay focused on the end problem of finding solutions for how do we manage our own respective operations for both the farmer and the consumer.  I think that's a great conversation to be involved in, so thank you.   
And to our public members who are here today, thank you for being patient.  And for those who offer comment, we appreciate that.    
Tomorrow we're back up here at 9:00 a.m.  Okay.   
MR. SCHECHTMAN:  You will be able \-- I know people are going to try to zip out of here to catch flights.  By all means, bring your suitcases or whatever garment things you have.  We'll probably be stacked to the rafters with those things.  And make sure if you have cell phones in them, that they are shut off.    
But, you know, we expect that you will be able to do that.  And also let me thank you for your endurance and willingness to have conversations.  And once we get off the record, if there is nothing else, let me just talk about dinner now that we're off the record.    
(Whereupon, at 5:04 p.m., the meeting was adjourned.)
